but O
in O
resume O
this O
computer O
rocks O
! O

Set B-AS
up I-AS
was O
easy O
. O

Did O
not O
enjoy O
the O
new O
Windows B-AS
8 I-AS
and O
touchscreen B-AS
functions I-AS
. O

I O
expected O
so O
as O
it O
's O
an O
Apple O
product O
, O
but O
I O
was O
glad O
to O
see O
my O
expectations O
exceeded O
, O
this O
is O
THE O
laptop O
to O
buy O
right O
now O
. O

Other O
than O
not O
being O
a O
fan O

pads I-AS
( O
industry O
standard O
these O
days O
) O
and O
the O
lousy O

, O
it O
's O
hard O
for O
me O
to O
find O
things O
about O
this O
notebook O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
, O
especially O
considering O
the O
$ O

price B-AS
tag I-AS
. O

excellent O
in O
every O
way O
. O

No O
installation B-AS
disk I-AS
( I-AS
DVD I-AS
) I-AS
is O
included O
. O

It O
's O
fast O
, O
light O
, O
and O
simple O
to O
use B-AS
. O

Works B-AS
well O
, O
and O
I O
am O
extremely O
happy O
to O
be O
back O
to O
an O
apple B-AS
OS I-AS
. O

This O
mac O
has O
been O
a O
problem O
since O
we O
got O
it O
. O

Sure O
it O
's O
not O
light O
and O
slim O
but O
the O
features B-AS
make O
up O
for O
it O
100 O
% O
. O

I O
am O
pleased O
with O
the O
fast O
log B-AS
on I-AS
, O
speedy O
WiFi B-AS
connection I-AS
and O
the O
long O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
( O
> O
6 O
hrs O
) O
. O

The O
Apple O
engineers O
have O
not O
yet O
discovered O
the O
delete B-AS
key I-AS
. O

Made O
interneting B-AS
( O
part O
of O
my O
business O
) O
very O
difficult O
to O
maintain O
. O

Luckily O
, O
for O
all O
of O
us O
contemplating O
the O
decision O
, O
the O
Mac O
Mini O
is O
priced B-AS
just O
right O
. O

Small O
and O
still O
VERY O
powerful O
. O

I O
had O
gotten O
this O
model O
for O
$ O
1199.00 O
on O
my O
State O
's O
tax- O
free O
weekend O
and O
had O
a O
$ O
100 O
off O
coupon O
for O
a O
MacBook O
at O
the O
local O
BestBuy O
! O

Super O
light O
, O
super O
sexy O
and O
everything O
just O
works B-AS
. O

Only O
problem O
that O
I O
had O
was O
that O
the O
track B-AS
pad I-AS
was O
not O
very O
good O
for O
me O
, O
I O
only O
had O
a O
problem O
once O
or O
twice O
with O
it O
, O
But O
probably O
my O
computer O
was O
a O
bit O
defective O
. O

And O
if O
you O
are O
switching O
from O
a O
pc O
I O
hilghy O
sugest O
this O
one O
. O

It O
is O
super O
fast O
and O
has O
outstanding O
graphics B-AS
. O

But O
the O
mountain B-AS
lion I-AS
is O
just O
too O
slow O
. O

Strong O
build B-AS
though O
which O
really O
adds O
to O
its O
durability B-AS
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
excellent O
- O
6 O
- O
7 O
hours O
without O
charging O
. O

I O
enjoy O
having O
apple O
products O
. O

I O
've O
had O
my O
computer O
for O
2 O
weeks O
already O
and O
it O
works B-AS
perfectly O
. O

I O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
a O
PC O
again O
! O

And O
I O
may O
be O
the O
only O
one O
but O
I O
am O
really O
liking O
Windows B-AS
8 I-AS
. O

The O
baterry B-AS
is O
very O
longer O
. O

And O
it O
's O
so O
quiet O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
hear O
it O
at O
all O
. O

Its O
size B-AS
is O
ideal O
and O
the O
weight B-AS
is O
acceptable O
. O

I O
know O
Apples O
are O
more O
expensive O
than O
PCs O
, O
but O
he O
thinks O
it O
is O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O

To O
me O
it O
's O
a O
workhorse O
... O
and O
quiet O
as O
can O
be O
... O
you O
even O
save O
big O
bucks O
not O
dishing O
out O
any O
extra O
to O
Uncle O
Sam O
... O
Definite O
Buy O
... O

I O
can O
say O
that O
I O
am O
fully O
satisfied O
with O
the O
performance B-AS
that O
the O
computer O
has O
supplied O
. O

I O
'm O
pretty O
sure O
when O
I O
bought O
it O
, O
my O
bank O
account O
went O
'ouch O
! O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
the O
great O
item O
. O

This O
laptop O
has O
only O
2 O
USB B-AS
ports I-AS
, O
and O
they O
are O
both O
on O
the O
same O
side O
. O

It O
's O
annoying O
very O
much O
and O
I O
wo O
n't O
ever O
buy O
any O
Acer O
products O
. O

This O
is O
why O
I O
purchased O
a O
BRAND O
NEW O
LAPTOP O
in O
the O
first O
place O
so O
it O
would O
n't O
have O
ANY O
problems O
. O

It O
has O
so O
much O
more O
speed B-AS
and O
the O
screen B-AS
is O
very O
sharp O
. O

As O
for O
the O
laptop O
, O
this O
is O
our O
3rd O
Apple O
computer O
in O
the O
past O
2 O
years O
. O

Everything O
I O
wanted O
and O
everything O
I O
needed O
and O
the O
price B-AS
was O
great O
! O

It O
's O
not O
inexpensive O
but O
the O
Hardware B-AS
performance I-AS
is O
impressive O
for O
a O
computer O
this O
small O
. O

It O
is O
better O
than O
my O
old O
acer O
laptop O
. O

This O
thing O
is O
awesome O
, O
everything O
always O
works B-AS
, O
everything O
is O
always O
easy O
to O
set B-AS
up I-AS
, O
everything O
is O
compatible O
, O
its O
literally O
everything O
I O
could O
ask O
for O
. O

I O
would O
buy O
it O
again O
in O
a O
heartbeat O
! O

Keyboard B-AS
responds O
well O
to O
presses O
. O

If O
someone O
called O
me O
an O
Apple O
Fanboy O
... O
it O
would O
make O
sense O
. O

Lastly O
, O
Windows B-AS
8 I-AS
is O
annoying O
. O

A O
scratch O
on O
a O
$ O
1,500 O
MacBook O
is O
unforgivable O
. O

I O
just O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
this O
thing O
. O

Everything O
is O
so O
easy O
and O
intuitive O
to O
setup B-AS
or O
configure B-AS
. O

I O
have O
no O
problems O
yet O
on O
my O
mac O
so O
far O
, O
and O
hope O
it O
stays O
like O
that O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
a O
great O
buy O
. O

Biggest O
complaint O
is O
Windows B-AS
8 I-AS
. O

Only O
2 O
usb B-AS
ports I-AS
... O
seems O
kind O
of O
... O
limited O
. O

It O
has O
been O
to O
early O
to O
see O
if O
this O
actually O
fixes O
the O
problem O
or O
not O
though O
. O

This O
device O
has O
met O
my O
expectations O
and O
I O
'm O
sure O
it O
will O
meet O
yours O
. O

It O
has O
all O
the O
expected O
features B-AS
and O
more O
+plus O
a O
wide O
screen B-AS
and O
more O
than O
roomy O
keyboard B-AS
. O

Out O
of O
all O
the O
laptops O
I O
have O
owned O
, O
this O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
! O

Amazing O
Performance B-AS
for O
anything O
I O
throw O
at O
it O
. O

I O
can O
never O
go O
back O
to O
a O
PC O
now O
, O
this O
machine O
never O
freezes O
or O
has O
any O
problems O
. O

Out O
of O
the O
box O
I O
noticed O
how O
small O
it O
was O
and O
was O
exactly O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

The O
receiver O
was O
full O
of O
superlatives O
for O
the O
quality B-AS
and O
performance B-AS
. O

I O
was O
extremely O
happy O
with O
the O
OS B-AS
itself O
. O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
something O
in O
between O
a O
regular O
laptop O
and O
a O
tablet O
and O
this O
is O
it O
. O

The O
new O
MBP O
offers O
great O
portability B-AS
and O
gives O
us O
confidence O
that O
we O
are O
not O
going O
to O
need O
to O
purchase O
a O
new O
laptop O
in O
18 O
months O
. O

Great O
purchase O
and O
I O
definitely O
did O
n't O
miss O
out O
on O
the O
Black O
Friday O
deals O
. O

The O
criticism O
has O
waned O
, O
and O
now O
I O
'd O
be O
the O
first O
to O
recommend O
an O
Air O
for O
truly O
portable B-AS
computing I-AS
. O

I O
would O
have O
given O
it O
5 O
starts O
was O
it O
not O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
had O
Windows B-AS
8 I-AS

MS B-AS
Office I-AS
2011 I-AS
for I-AS
Mac I-AS
is O
wonderful O
, O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

After O
using O
it O
for O
over O
a O
month O
, O
an O
issue O
started O
to O
surface O
. O

But O
the O
performance B-AS
of O
Mac O
Mini O
is O
a O
huge O
disappointment O
. O

There O
has O
been O
no O
problem O
with O
anything O
. O

I O
believe O
with O
Apple O
- O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
just O
look B-AS
good O
; O
they O
deliver O
excellent O
performance B-AS
. O

I O
have O
had O
it O
over O
a O
year O
now O
with O
out O
a O
Glitch O
of O
any O
kind..I O
love O
the O
lit B-AS
up I-AS
keys I-AS
and O
screen B-AS
display I-AS
... O
this O
thing O
is O
Fast O
and O
clear O
as O
can O
be O
. O

The O
product O
is O
prefect O
for O
everyone O
. O

The O
Mountain B-AS
Lion I-AS
OS I-AS
is O
not O
hard O
to O
figure O
out O
if O
you O
are O
familiar O
with O
Microsoft B-AS
Windows I-AS
. O

However O
, O
I O
can O
refute O
that O
OSX B-AS
is O
`` O
FAST O
'' O
. O

I O
waited O
to O
review O
to O
make O
sure O
it O
is O
what O
it O
is O
. O

Enjoy O
using O
Microsoft B-AS
Office I-AS
! O

I O
would O
suggest O
this O
product O
to O
anyone O
. O

With O
no O
problems O
, O
I O
'm O
happy O
with O
this O
purchase O
because O
I O
saved O
money O
compared O
to O
buying O
it O
anywhere O
else O
. O

Incredible O
graphics B-AS
and O
brilliant O
colors B-AS
. O

I O
needed O
something O
affordable O
from O
Apple O
and O
was O
tired O
of O
dealing O
with O
PC O
laptop O
after O
PC O
laptop O
. O

Just O
bit O
the O
bullet O
and O
bought O
the O
Mac O
hoping O
it O
will O
last O
a O
lot O
longer… O
. O

Built B-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
apps I-AS
are O
purely O
amazing O
. O

Cons O
: O
Screen B-AS
resolution I-AS
. O

From O
the O
speed B-AS
to O
the O
multi B-AS
touch I-AS
gestures I-AS
this O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
beats O
Windows B-AS
easily O
. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
size B-AS
and O
I O
'm O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
ACERS O
. O

This O
is O
by O
far O
thee O
best O
, O
most O
reliable O
computer O
I O
could O
find O
. O

I O
opted O
for O
the O
SquareTrade B-AS

that O
are O
NOT O
covered O
by O
AppleCare B-AS
. O

It O
's O
light O
and O
easy O
to O

Once O
you O
get O
past O
learning O
how O
to O
use O
the O
poorly O
designed O
Windows B-AS
8 I-AS
Set I-AS
- I-AS
Up I-AS
you O
may O
feel O
frustrated O
. O

Very O
powerful O
especially O
for O
the O
money O
. O

When O
my O
Dell O
laptop O
gave O
up O
only O
after O
2 O
1/ O
2 O
years O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
buy O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

It O
's O
been O
time O
for O
a O
new O
laptop O
, O
and O
the O
only O
debate O
was O
which O
size B-AS
of O
the O
Mac O
laptops O
, O
and O
whether O
to O
spring O
for O
the O
retina B-AS
display I-AS
. O

This O
was O
a O
significantly O
more O
affordable O
than O
getting O
a O
new O
MacBook O
Pro O
from O
Apple O
. O

I O
have O
always O
wanted O
a O
MacBook O
Pro O
... O
..always O
! O

The O
reason O
why O
I O
choose O
apple O
MacBook O
because O
of O
their O
design B-AS
and O
the O
aluminum B-AS
casing I-AS
. O

The O
aluminum B-AS
body I-AS
sure O
makes O
it O
stand O
out O
. O

Overall O
it O
's O
an O
amazing O
product O
, O
5 O
stars O
! O

It O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
integrate B-AS
bluetooth I-AS
devices I-AS
, O
and O
USB B-AS
devices I-AS
are O
recognized O
almost O
instantly O
. O

He O
's O
thrilled O
with O
his O
new O
laptop O
. O

Amazing O
product O
as O
you O
would O
expect O
from O
Apple O
. O

Nothing O
wrong O
with O
this O
computer O
at O
all O
! O

And O
the O
fact O
that O
Apple O
is O
driving O
the O
13 O
'' O
RMBP O
with O
the O
Intel4000 B-AS
graphic I-AS
chip I-AS
seems O
underpowered O
( O
to O
me O
. O

I O
have O
to O
wonder O
why O
Amazon O
is O
even O
selling O
this O
dinosaur O
. O

Apple O
removed O
the O
DVD B-AS
drive I-AS
Firewire I-AS
port I-AS
( O
will O
work O
with O
adapter B-AS
) O
and O
put O
the O
SDXC B-AS
slot I-AS
in O
a O
silly O
position O
on O
the O
back O
. O

No O
hassle O
and O
no O
complaints O
. O

LOVE O
IT O
I O
've O
always O
been O
an O
apple O
fan O
boy O
, O
but O
never O
had O
the O
money O
to O
buy O
a O
mac O
, O
only O
ipads O
and O
iphones O
, O
and O
this O
is O
my O
first O
mac O
, O
blew O
me O
away O
completely O
. O

The O
durability B-AS
of O
the O
laptop O
will O
make O
it O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

Well O
designed B-AS
and O
fast O
. O

And O
now O
I O
am O
a O
proud O
MacBook O
owner O
also O

But O
I O
was O
completely O
wrong O
, O
this O
computer O
is O
UNBELIEVABLE O
amazing O
and O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
. O

Exactly O
as O
posted O
plus O
a O
great O
value B-AS
. O

The O
specs B-AS
are O
pretty O
good O
too O
. O

I O
am O
having O
a O
friend O
look O
at O
it O
, O
but O
will O
probably O
return O
it O
. O

There O
were O
no O
scratches O
or O
dents O
or O
any O
marks O
at O
all O
. O

I O
've O
only O
had O
it O
one O
day O
, O
but O
I O
really O
do O
love O
it O
and O
I O
'm O
happy O
it O
was O
economical O
and O
I O
'm O
finally O
able O
to O
own O
a O

! O

Since O
I O
have O
always O
used O
Apple O

the O
choice O
of O

. O

I O
will O
also O
say O
it O
is O
much O
better O
than O
I O
expected O
! O

This O
computer O
does O
everything O
i O
need O
it O
to O
do O
for O
school O
and O
more O
. O

It O
is O
really O
thick O
around O
the O
battery B-AS
. O

And O
windows B-AS
7 I-AS
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

And O
I O
can O
attach O
my O
projector O
to O
it O
. O

: O
) O
Great O
product O
, O
great O
price B-AS
, O
great O
delivery B-AS
, O
and O
great O
service B-AS
. O

: O
] O
It O
arrived O
so O
fast O
and O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
was O
great O
. O

tried O
windows B-AS
8 I-AS
and O
hated O
it O
! O
! O
! O

The O
price B-AS
is O
higher O
than O
most O
lab O
top O
out O
there O
; O
however O
, O
he O
/ O
she O
will O
get O
what O
they O
paid O
for O
, O
which O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
. O

So O
, O
I O
thought O
why O
not O
give O
Mac O
Book O
pro O
a O
try O
. O

Set B-AS
up I-AS
was O
a O
breeze O
. O

But O
I O
do O
NOT O
like O
Win8 B-AS
. O

I O
have O
owned O
at O
least O
4 O
to O
5 O
laptops O
and O
computers O
- O
but O
this O
is O
by O
far O
the O
most O
superior O
machine O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O

I O
am O
still O
in O
the O
process O
of O
learning O
about O
its O
features B-AS
. O

BTW O
, O
I O
checked O
online O
regarding O
the O
old O
laptop O
that O
'died O
' O
and O
found O
that O
I O
was O
not O
alone O
, O
far O
from O
it O
. O

I O
had O
the O
same O
reasons O
as O
most O
PC O
users O
: O
the O
price B-AS
, O
the O
overbearing O
restrictions O
of O
OSX B-AS
and O
lack O
of O
support B-AS
for I-AS
games I-AS
. O

I O
wanted O
it O
for O
it O
's O
mobility B-AS
and O
man O
, O
this O
little O
bad O
boy O
is O
very O
nice O
. O

Seems O
to O
me O
that O
's O
the O
best O
way O
to O
get O
Apple O
's O
attention O
. O

Very O
nice O
so O
far O
. O

You O
wo O
n't O
be O
disappointed O
. O

The O
investment O
of O
a O
new O
MacBook O
Pro O
came O
at O
a O
price B-AS
, O
but O
totally O
worth O
it O
for O
a O
good O
piece O
of O
mind O
. O

I O
found O
the O
mini O
to O
be O
: O
Exceptionally O
easy O
to O
set B-AS
up I-AS

Having O
USB3 B-AS
is O
why O
I O
bought O
this O
Mini O
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
have O
good O
air O
flow O
where O
ever O
you O
put O
it O
. O

The O
sound B-AS
is O
nice O
and O
loud O
; O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
problems O
with O
hearing O
anything O
. O

It O
is O
very O
slim O
, O
the O
track B-AS
pad I-AS
is O
very O
much O
impressed O
with O
me O
. O

This O
was O
the O
same O
problem O
with O
my O
MacBook O
( O
circa O
2007 O
) O
that O
I O
just O
retired O
. O

Great O
things O
come O
in O
small O
`` O
packages O
. O

HUGE O
Apple O
MAC O
Fan O
! O

Looked O
at O
HP O
, O
ASUS O
, O
Acer O
, O
Sony O
and O
a O
bunch O
of O
other O
ones O
but O
could O
not O
find O
I O
really O
liked O
. O

The O
settings B-AS
are O
not O
user O
- O
friendly O
either O
. O

Honestly O
, O
I O
am O
surprised O
no O
one O
else O
has O
mentioned O
returning O
theirs O
. O

Most O
of O
them O
were O
either O
too O
big O
, O
too O
noisy O
and O
too O
slow O
after O
2 O
years O
. O

The O
machine O
is O
used O
, O
but O
is O
like O
new O
, O
i O
'm O
very O
impress O
. O

Thank O
goodness O
for O
OpenOffice B-AS
! O

Awesome O
form B-AS
factor I-AS
, O
great O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
, O
wonderful O
UX B-AS
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
, O
the O
leap O
from O
that O
to O
this O
has O
been O
amazing O
and O
( O
aside O
from O
the O
financial O
reasons O
) O
I O
am O
astounded O
that O
I O
had O
n't O
made O
the O
switch O
sooner O
. O

Its O
perfect O
, O
not O
much O
heavy O
. O

i O
love O
the O
keyboard B-AS
and O
the O
screen B-AS
. O

I O
find O
it O
not O
to O
be O
very O
user O
friendly O
. O

It O
has O
surpassed O
all O
expectations O
and O
fulfilled O
all O
my O
needs O
. O

However O
, O
there O
are O
MAJOR O
issues O
with O
the O
touchpad B-AS
which O
render O
the O
device O
nearly O
useless O
. O

What O
angers O
me O
more O
than O
anything O
else O
is O
that O
I O
spent O
all O
those O
years O
hating O
MACs O
when O
I O
could O
have O
been O
getting O
a O
lot O
more O
production O
with O
a O
whole O
lot O
less O
grief O
! O

I O
've O
already O
upgraded O
o O
Mavericks B-AS
and O
I O
am O
impressed O
with O
everything O
about O
this O
computer O
. O

So O
this O
is O
very O
good O
commputer O
and O
i O
highly O
suggest O
it O
. O

the O
mbp O
i O
recieved O
was O
everything O
it O
should O
have O
been O
. O

I O
was O
going O
to O
buy O
today O
and O
noticed O
it O
went O
back O
up O
to O
$ O
344.99 O
? O

Not O
as O
fast O
as O
I O
would O
have O
expect O
for O
an O
i5 B-AS
. O

SO O
of O
course O
this O
one O
came O
through O
with O
the O
awesomeness O
! O

You O
will O
not O
regret O
buying O
this O
computer O
! O

Nothing O
bad O
to O
say O
about O
it O
. O

It O
s O
heavy O
for O
Mac O
book O
but O
is O
good O
. O

thanks O
for O
great O
service B-AS
and O
shipping B-AS
! O

Deal O
of O
the O
year O
. O

My O
sisters O
same O
laptop O
broke O
about O
the O
month O
later O
for O
the O
same O
reason O
. O

Minis O
make O
sense O
for O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
. O

The O
performance B-AS
seems O
quite O
good O
, O
and O
built B-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
applications I-AS
like O
iPhoto B-AS
work O
great O
with O
my O
phone O
and O
camera O
. O

This O
Mac O
Mini O
makes O
the O
Macbook O
Pro O
seem O
slow O
. O

I O
did O
swap O
out O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
for O
a O
Samsung B-AS
830 I-AS
SSD I-AS
which O
I O
highly O
recommend O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
MacBook O
Pro O
to O
replace O
my O
six- O
year- O
old O
PC O
( O
a O
Sony O
Vaio O
) O
, O
but O
it O
was O
basically O
no O
better O
than O
my O
old O
PC O
, O
so O
I O
returned O
it O
. O

I O
wanted O
a O
simple O
, O
reliable O
laptop O
. O

Cheaper O
than O
buying O
it O
@ O
apple O
too O
! O

I O
have O
just O
had O
to O
learn O
to O
be O
a O
little O
harder O
typer O
than O
on O
my O
last O
computer O
. O

Extremely O
disappointed O
with O
the O
way O
it O
is O
. O

Never O
been O
happier O
using O
computer O
. O

I O
have O
had O
a O
total O
of O
5 O
different O
laptop O
from O
many O
different O
manufactures O
. O

Does O
everything O
I O
wanted O
this O
laptop O
to O
do O
. O

Besides O
, O
the O
apple O
stocks O
have O
been O
falling O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
sales O
. O

Turns O
out O
this O
is O
a O
common O
problem O
. O

Starts B-AS
up I-AS
in O
a O
hurry O
and O
everything O
is O
ready O
to O
go O
. O

It O
is O
also O
fast O
as O
can O
be O
... O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
... O
well O
worth O
the O
investment O

But O
I O
'm O
still O
learning O
so O
ca O
n't O
rate O
it O
yet O
for O
everything O
. O

Overall O
very O
impressed O
, O
Thank O
you O
Apple O
and O
Amazon O
! O

Yes O
, O
that O
's O
a O
good O
thing O
, O
but O
it O
's O
made O
from O
aluminum B-AS
that O
scratches O
easily O
. O

Very O
fast O
for O
my O
needs O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
Mac O
in O
order O
to O
replace O
my O
old O
Dell O
laptop O
. O

Quick O
and O
has O
built B-AS
in I-AS
virus I-AS
control I-AS
. O

Took O
a O
long O
time O
trying O
to O
decide O
between O
one O
with O
retina B-AS
display I-AS
and O
one O
without O
. O

I O
saw O
the O
Mini O
Mac O
at O
Best O
Buy O
and O
decided O
to O
get O
this O
as O
my O
replacement O
. O

I O
finally O
decided O
on O
this O
one O
and O
could O
n't O
be O
any O
happier O
. O

I O
was O
also O
informed O
that O
the O
components B-AS
of O
the O
Mac O
Book O
were O
dirty O
. O

So O
glad O
I O
did O
not O
waste O
money O
on O
a O
less O
than O
par O
product O
. O

Have O
n't O
regretted O
it O
one O
bit O
. O

The O
one O
thing O
that O
Apple O
does O
right O
is O
computers O
. O

the O
hardware B-AS
problems O
have O
been O
so O
bad O
, O
i O
ca O
n't O
wait O
till O
it O
completely O
dies O
in O
3 O
years O
, O
TOPS O
! O

It O
's O
so O
nice O
that O
the O
battery B-AS
last O
so O
long O
and O
that O
this O
machine O
has O
the O
snow B-AS
lion I-AS
! O

I O
think O
that O
they O
are O
the O
best O
out O
on O
the O
market O
. O

HOWEVER O
I O
chose O
two O
day O
shipping B-AS
and O
it O
took O
over O
a O
week O
to O
arrive O
. O

That O
's O
quite O
a O
bump O
up O
from O
the O
$ O
599 O
that O
this O
little O
guy O
sells O
for O
, O
which O
leaves O
me O
to O
my O
next O
point O
. O

this O
is O
quite O
smooth O
as O
well O
as O
heavy O
and O
can O
easily O
slip O
through O
the O
hands O
. O

My O
laptop O
is O
so O
light O
that O
I O
can O
take O
it O
with O
me O
anywhere O
. O

it O
's O
exactly O
what O
i O
wanted O
, O
and O
it O
has O
all O
the O
new O
features B-AS
and O
whatnot O
. O

You O
can O
do O
absolutely O
anything O
and O
is O
very O
fast O
and O
stylish O
. O

Finally O
decided O
to O
try O
a O
MAC O
because O
there O
were O
too O
many O
choices O
of O
which O
PC O
's O
to O
buy O
and O
EVERYONE O
who O
had O
a O
MAC O
said O
`` O
buy O
a O
MAC O
'' O
. O

Can O
you O
buy O
any O
laptop O
that O
matches O
the O
quality B-AS
of O
a O
MacBook O
? O

It O
feels O
cheap O
, O
the O
keyboard B-AS
is O
not O
very O
sensitive O
. O

That O
defeated O
the O
whole O
point O
of O
a O
laptop O
. O

Though O
please O
note O
that O
sometimes O
it O
crashes O
, O
and O
the O
sound B-AS
quality I-AS
isnt O
superb O
. O

It O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
navigate B-AS
even O
for O
a O
novice O
. O

But O
until O
now O
, O
no O
complains O
at O
all O
. O

The O
cons O
are O
more O
annoyances O
that O
can O
be O
lived O
with O
. O

Does O
everything O
I O
need O
it O
to O
, O
has O
a O
wonderful O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
and O
I O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
. O

Great O
Performance B-AS
and O
Quality B-AS
. O

Just O
What O
I O
Needed O
For O
Portable O
And O
My O
Wallet O
Too O
! O

The O
device O
speaks O
about O
it O
self O
. O

I O
used O
windows B-AS
XP I-AS
, O
windows B-AS
Vista I-AS
, O
and O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
extensively O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
that O
bums O
me O
out O
about O
this O
purchase O
is O
they O
released O
a O
newer O
updated O
mbp O
seriously O
RIGHT O
after O
i O
bought O
this O
one O
. O

it O
does O
get O
hot O
when O
using O
on O
a O
bed O
or O
sofa O
and O
gets O
warm O
on O
a O
desk O
... O
.this O
is O
in O
an O
un- O
air O
conditioned O
room O
... O
..in O
air O
condition O
it O
gets O
slightly O
warm O
... O
... O

I O
did O
add O
a O
SSD B-AS
drive I-AS
and O
memory B-AS

I O
got O
this O
one O
for O
thanks O
giving O
Offer O
for O
$ O
962 O
: O
) O
. O

I O
had O
my O
PC O
laptop O
for O
3 O
years O
and O
going O
to O
a O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
like O
I O
leaped O
through O
time O
. O

On O
start B-AS
up I-AS
it O
asks O
endless O
questions O
just O
so O
itune B-AS
can O
sell O
you O
more O
of O
their O
products O
. O

Pretty O
much O
made O
sense O
to O
get O
a O
Mini O
. O

I O
Have O
been O
a O
Pc O
user O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
now O
but O
I O
will O
get O
used O
to O
this O
new O
OS B-AS
. O

not O
something O
you O
want O
to O
miss O
out O
on O
! O
! O
! O

One O
more O
thing O
, O
this O
mac O
does O
NOT O
come O
with O
restore B-AS
disks I-AS
and O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
if O
you O
can O
make O
them O
direct O
from O
the O
mac O
like O
you O
can O
with O
newer O
PC O
's O
, O
also O
the O
charging B-AS
cables I-AS
are O
made O
of O
the O
same O
cheap O
material B-AS
as O
the O
iPhone O
/ O
iPod O
touch O
cables O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
to O
my O
son O
who O
uses O
it O
for O
graphic B-AS
design I-AS
. O

I O
previously O
owned O
an O
older O
Dell O
laptop O
that O
died O
after O
about O
5 O
or O
6 O
years O
. O

Its O
a O
pretty O
decent O
computer O
. O

I O
never O
tried O
any O
external B-AS
mics I-AS
with O
that O
iMac O
. O

The O
new O
os B-AS
is O
great O
on O
my O
macbook O
pro O
! O

It O
was O
fast O
, O
and O
it O
was O
`` O
different O
'' O
. O

I O
had O
a O
little O
problem O
adjusting O
to O
the O
small O
screen B-AS
but O
works O
fine O
as O
long O
as O
I O
remember O
to O
carry O
my O
glasses O
. O

I O
purchased O
my O
first O
Mac O
and O
am O
glad O
I O
did O
. O

I O
have O
experienced O
no O
problems O
, O
works B-AS
as O
anticipated O
. O

System B-AS
is O
running O
great O
. O

Easy O
to O
customize B-AS
setting I-AS
and O
even O
create B-AS
your I-AS
own I-AS
bookmarks I-AS
. O

They O
really O
screwed O
the O
pooch O
on O
this O
one O
. O

The O
MAC O
Mini O
, O
wireless B-AS
keyboard I-AS
/ I-AS
mouse I-AS
and O
a O
HDMI B-AS
cable I-AS
is O
all O
I O
need O
to O
get O
some O
real O
work O
done O
. O

I O
finally O
pulled O
the O
trigger O
and O
I O
am O
blown O
away O
by O
how O
much O
more O
I O
enjoy O
my O
computer O
tasks O
using O
the O
Mac O
Mini O
! O
! O
! O

it O
has O
all O
the O
features B-AS
that O
we O
expected O
and O
the O
price B-AS
was O
good O
, O
working B-AS
well O
so O
far O
. O

I O
work O
as O
a O
designer O
and O
coder O
and O
I O
needed O
a O
new O
buddy O
to O
work O
with O
, O
not O
gaming B-AS
. O

I O
was O
told O
that O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
multi O
- O
component O
failure O
. O

The O
new O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
makes O
this O
computer O
into O
a O
super O
iPad O
. O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
my O
first O
Mac O
. O

Easy O
to O
set B-AS
up I-AS
and O
go O
! O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
how O
quiet O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
is O
and O
how O
quick O
this O
thing O
boots B-AS
up I-AS
. O

The O
only O
issue O
came O
when O
I O
tried O
scanning B-AS
to O
the O
mac O
. O

The O
machine O
is O
speedy O
and O
efficient O
. O

I O
think O
this O
is O
about O
as O
good O
as O
it O
gets O
at O
anything O
close O

A O
* O
big* O
upgrade O
from O
my O
13 O
'' O
2006 O
macbook O
. O

It O
's O
just O
what O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
and O
it O
works B-AS
great O
. O

Having O
a O
Mac O
certainly O
makes O
life O
easier O
. O

It O
's O
so O
quick O
and O
responsive O
that O
it O
makes O
working B-AS
/ O
surfing B-AS
on O
a O
computer O
so O
much O
more O
pleasurable O
! O

The O
old O
unibody O
macbook O
pro O
could O
fry O
an O
egg O
after O
a O
while O
. O

It O
works B-AS
fine O
, O
and O
all O
the O
software B-AS
seems O
to O
run O
pretty O
well O
. O

For O
this O
purpose O
, O
it O
's O
great O
. O

Could O
n't O
have O
asked O
for O
more O
! O

I O
'm O
using O
this O
computer O
for O
word B-AS
processing I-AS
, O
web B-AS
browsing I-AS
, O
some O
gaming B-AS
, O
and O
I O
'm O
learning O
programming B-AS
. O

It O
certainly O
does O
, O
but O
you O
rarely O
hear O
any O
of O
your O
friends O
with O
Mac O
's O
complain O
about O
anything O
. O

My O
wife O
was O
so O
excited O
to O
open O
the O
box O
, O
but O
quickly O
came O
to O
see O
that O
it O
did O
not O
function B-AS
as O
it O
should O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
technical O
pearls O
to O
share O
. O

I O
wanted O
a O
computer O
that O
was O
quite O
, O
fast O
, O
and O
that O
had O
overall O
great O
performance B-AS
. O

Apple B-AS
`` I-AS
Help I-AS
'' I-AS
is O
a O
mixed O
bag O
. O

All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
I O
am O
impressed O
. O

It O
suddenly O
can O
not O
work B-AS
. O

It O
did O
everything O
we O
expected O
! O

Harddrive B-AS
was O
in O
poor O
condition O
, O
had O
to O
replace O
it O
. O

The O
on B-AS
/ I-AS
off I-AS
switch I-AS
is O
a O
bit O
obscure O
in O
the O
rear O
corner O
. O

It O
's O
a O
nice O
little O
gadget O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
is O
the O
total O
lack O
of O
instructions B-AS
that O
come O
with O
the O
mac O
mini O
. O

The O
only O
task O
that O
this O
computer O
would O
not O
be O
good O
enough O
for O
would O
be O
gaming B-AS
, O
otherwise O
the O
integrated B-AS
Intel I-AS
4000 I-AS
graphics I-AS
work O
well O
for O
other O
tasks O
. O

It O
's O
macbook O
pro O
and O
there O
is O
no O
discusion O
about O
it O
. O

I O
'm O
hoping O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
features B-AS
will O
be O
the O
signature O
quality O
of O
apple O
. O

I O
use O
it O
mostly O
for O
content B-AS
creation I-AS
( O
Audio B-AS
, O
video B-AS
, O
photo B-AS
editing I-AS
) O
and O
its O
reliable O
. O

It O
is O
the O
best O
all O
around O
Mac O
. O

Screen B-AS
is O
bright O
and O
gorgeous O
. O

Also O
is O
portable O
and O
reliable O
. O

The O
only O
solution O
is O
to O
turn O
the O
brightness B-AS
down O
, O
etc O
. O

It O
is O
not O
an O
easy O
decision O
to O
purchase O
a O
used O
or O
even O
good O
as O
new O
laptop O
but O
I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
. O

If O
you O
want O
more O
information O
on O
macs O
I O
suggest O
going O
to O
apple.com O
and O
heading O
towards O
the O
macbook O
page O
for O
more O
information O
on O
the O
applications B-AS
. O

It O
is O
robust O
, O
with O
a O
friendly O
use B-AS
as O
all O
Apple O
products O
. O

Even O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
do O
business O
, O
thats O
okay O
, O
it O
's O
incredibly O
fast O
. O

It O
is O
fast O
and O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
. O

This O
was O
absolutely O
annoying O
! O

And O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
comes O
with O
an O
i5 B-AS
processor I-AS
definitely O
speeds O
things O
up O

But O
for O
those O
of O
you O
that O
dont O
have O
a O
mac O
and O
are O
still O
on O
the O
PC O
's O
this O
is O
a O
good O
foot O
in O
the O
door O
into O
mac O
. O

I O
have O
been O
PC O
for O
years O
but O
this O
computer O
is O
intuitive O
and O
its O
built B-AS
in I-AS
features I-AS
are O
a O
great O
help O

and O
it O
fits O
in O
my O
briefcase O
with O
ease O

Nice O
screen B-AS
, O
keyboard B-AS
works O
great O
! O

Still O
not O
bad O
for O
220.00 O
. O

I O
was O
amazed O
at O
how O
fast O
the O
delivery B-AS
was O
. O

Good O
computer O
and O
fast O
. O

I O
've O
installed O
to O
it O
additional O
SSD B-AS
and O
16Gb B-AS
RAM I-AS
. O

The O
memory B-AS
was O
gone O
and O
it O
was O
not O
able O
to O
be O
used O
. O

Its O
pretty O
much O
fire O
it O
up O
and O
go O
. O

It O
works B-AS
great O
and O
I O
am O
so O
happy O
I O
bought O
it O
. O

Let O
me O
start O
off O
by O
saying O
that O
I O
was O
highly O
reluctant O
to O
spend O
so O
much O
money O
on O
a O
laptop O
. O

I O
like O
the O
design B-AS
and O
ease O
of O
use O
with O
the O
keyboard B-AS
, O
plenty O
of O
ports B-AS
. O

Apple O
is O
living O
up O
to O
its O
name O
with O
the O
mini O
and O
, O
for O
our O
needs O
, O
it O
's O
perfect O
. O

it O
definitely O
beats O
my O
old O
mac O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
great O
. O

I O
went O
from O
a O
Macbook O
to O
this O
Mac O
Mini O
and O
this O
was O
a O
great O
upgrade O
! O

Web B-AS
browsing I-AS
is O
very O
quick O
with O
Safari B-AS
browser I-AS
. O

It O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
a O
better O
decision O
. O

I O
like O
the O
lighted B-AS
screen I-AS
at O
night O
. O

It O
's O
great O
to O
have O
a O
solid O
Mac O
in O
the O
living O
room O
. O

It O
is O
really O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
and O
it O
is O
quick O
to O
start B-AS
up I-AS
. O

I O
've O
lived O
with O
the O
crashes O
and O
slow O
operation B-AS
and O
restarts O
. O

Very O
light O
and O
easily O
maneuverable O
. O

USB3 B-AS
Peripherals I-AS
are O
noticably O
less O
expensive O
than O
the O
ThunderBolt B-AS
ones O
. O

This O
can O
be O
annoying O
at O
first O
but O
you O
just O
have O
to O
train O
yourself O
not O
to O
to O
start O
over O
so O
far O
. O

And O
mine O
had O
broke O
but O
I O
sent O
it O
in O
under O
warranty B-AS
- O
no O
problems O
. O

I O
am O
not O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O

It O
's O
fast O
, O
light O
, O
and O
is O
perfect O
for O
media B-AS
editing I-AS
, O
which O
is O
mostly O
why O
I O
bought O
it O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

However O
, O
the O
machine O
itself O
left O
a O
bit O
to O
be O
desired O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
lasts O
as O
advertised O
( O
give O
or O
take O
15 O
- O
20 O
minutes O
) O
, O
and O
the O
entire O
user B-AS
experience I-AS
is O
very O
elegant O
. O

I O
spent O
months O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
laptop O
for O
me O
and O
I O
finally O
found O
it O
! O

$ O
999.00 O
Tax O
free O
. O

Thanks O
for O
the O
fast O
shipment B-AS
and O
great O
price B-AS
. O

! O
Excelent O
performance B-AS
, O
usability B-AS
, O
presentation B-AS
and O
time B-AS
response I-AS
. O

The O
smaller O
size B-AS
was O
a O
bonus O
because O
of O
space O
restrictions O
. O

I O
blame O
the O
Mac B-AS
OS I-AS
. O

But O
for O
now O
, O
this O
laptop O
is O
still O
a O
workhorse O
. O

In O
fact O
I O
still O
use O
many O
Legacy B-AS
programs I-AS
( O
Appleworks B-AS
, O
FileMaker B-AS
Pro I-AS
, O
Quicken B-AS
, O
Photoshop B-AS
etc O
) O
! O

It O
's O
small O
but O
powerful O
, O
light O
but O
strong O
, O
elegant O
and O
beautiful O
... O
In O
resume O
: O
it O
's O
a O
Mac O
! O

I O
like O
the O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
. O

I O
wish O
I O
would O
have O
taken O
the O
plunge O
years O
ago O
. O

I O
love O
the O
form B-AS
factor I-AS
. O

I O
have O
n't O
used O
the O
product O
long O
enough O
to O
write O
a O
detailed O
technical O
review O
. O

It O
's O
fast O
at O
loading B-AS
the I-AS
internet I-AS
. O

So O
much O
faster O
and O
sleeker O
looking B-AS
. O

I O
plan O
on O
using O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
it O
runs O
XP B-AS
and O
Microsoft O
is O
dropping O
support B-AS
next O
April O
. O

Its O
seen O
in O
movies O
, O
sitcoms O
, O
prominent O
important O
people O
carry O
and O
use O
them O
and O
they O
are O
GREAT O
! O

First O
off O
, O
I O
really O
do O
like O
my O
MBP O
... O
once O
used O
to O
the O
OS B-AS
it O
is O
pretty O
easy O
to O
get O
around O
, O
and O
the O
overall B-AS
build I-AS
is O
great O
... O
eg O
the O
keyboard B-AS
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
to O
type O
on O
. O

Does O
exactly O
what O
I O
bought O
it O
4 O
. O

Buy O
the O
Mac O
Mini O
it O
's O
a O
terribly O
great O
machine O
. O

It O
is O
made O
of O
such O
solid O
construction B-AS
and O
since O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
Mac O
using O
my O
iPhone O
helped O
me O
get O
used O
to O
the O
system B-AS
a O
bit O
. O

I O
love O
this O
piece O
of O
equipment O
, O
It O
will O
be O
hard O
to O
go O
back O
to O
other O
type O
of O
laptop O
after O
using O
a O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

Very O
nice O
unibody B-AS
construction I-AS
. O

Very O
disappointed O
with O
Apple O
. O

This O
Macbook O
Pro O
is O
fast O
, O
powerful O
, O
and O
runs B-AS
super O
quiet O
and O
cool O
. O

The O
review O
below O
is O
no O
longer O
relevant O
, O
Apple O
has O
fixed O
the O
issue O
. O

It O
's O
ok O
but O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
disk B-AS
drive I-AS
which O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
until O
after O
I O
bought O
it O
. O

There O
is O
no O
HDMI B-AS
receptacle I-AS
, O
nor O
is O
there O
an O
SD B-AS
card I-AS
slot I-AS
located O
anywhere O
on O
the O
device O
. O

It O
really O
is O
very O
light O
compared O
to O
other O
computers O
. O

It O
came O
in O
brand O
new O
and O
works B-AS
perfectly O
. O

This O
machine O
is O
A- O
mazing O
. O

It O
should O
n't O
happen O
like O
that O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
design B-AS
app I-AS
open O
or O
anything O
. O

MY O
TRACKPAD B-AS
IS O
NOT O
WORKING O
. O

I O
just O
hope O
this O
expensive O
laptop O
does O
n't O
go O
dead O
like O
my O
friends O
... O
it O
did O
last O
him O
5 O
good O
years O
before O
it O
bit O
the O
dust O
. O

Considering O
another O
computer O
should O
be O
out O
of O
the O
question O

It O
looks B-AS
and O
feels B-AS
solid O
, O
with O
a O
flawless O
finish B-AS
. O

Its O
worth O
every O
Penny O
. O

Price B-AS
was O
higher O
when O
purchased O
on O
MAC O
when O
compared O
to O
price B-AS
showing O
on O
PC O
when O
I O
bought O
this O
product O
. O

This O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
for O
a O
decked O
out O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

Then O
the O
system B-AS
would O
many O
times O
not O
power B-AS
down I-AS
without O
a O
forced O
power O
- O
off O
. O

Get O
this O
instead O
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
be O
sorry O
. O

The O
configuration B-AS
is O
perfect O
for O
my O
needs O
. O

and O
the O
speakers B-AS
is O
the O
worst O
ever O
. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
around O
16 O
hundred O
bucks O
last O
I O
checked O
. O

Its O
the O
best O
, O
its O
got O
the O
looks B-AS
, O
super O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
and O
love O
all O
you O
can O
do O
with O
the O
trackpad B-AS
! O
.. O

It O
's O
fast O
, O
quiet O
, O
incredibly O
small O
and O
affordable O
compared O
to O
other O
Mac O
models O
. O

Web B-AS
surfuring I-AS
is O
smooth O
and O
seamless O
. O

It O
was O
so O
exciting O
for O
me O
to O
unwrapp O
my O
new O
mac O
. O

I O
'm O
overall O
pleased O
with O
the O
interface B-AS
and O
the O
portability B-AS
of O
this O
product O
. O

so O
when O
I O
had O
the O
money O
to O
buy O
one O
I O
bought O
other O
things O
instead O
... O
.a O
700 O
laptop O
and O
some O
extra O
stuff O
with O
it O
. O

This O
item O
is O
a O
beautiful O
piece O
, O
it O
works B-AS
well O
, O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
carry B-AS
and O
handle B-AS
. O

See O
retired O
recently O
and O
decided O
that O
she O
wanted O
a O
laptop O
. O

It O
was O
also O
suffering O
from O
hardware B-AS
( I-AS
keyboard I-AS
) I-AS
issues O
, O
relatively O
slow O
performance B-AS
and O
shortening O
battery B-AS
lifetime I-AS
. O

I O
'm O
no O
regular O
customer O
I O
hate O
wasting O
my O
time O
with O
hellos O
and O
how O
can O
I O
help O
you O
's O
. O

Runs B-AS
good O
and O
does O
the O
job O
, O
ca O
n't O
complain O
about O
that O
! O

It O
's O
silent O
and O
has O
a O
very O
small O
footprint B-AS
on O
my O
desk O
. O

I O
have O
nothing O
to O
regret O
from O
this O
new O
product O
. O

The O
exterior B-AS
is O
absolutely O
gorgeous O
. O

Have O
one O
myself O
and O
Love O
it O
! O

It O
has O
a O
very O
high O
performance B-AS
, O
just O
for O
what O
I O
needed O
for O
. O

This O
is O
especially O
disheartening O
when O
Apple O
prides O
itself O
as O
the O
choice O
of O
creative O
professionals O
. O

Apple O
is O
aware O
of O
this O
issue O
and O
this O
is O
either O
old O
stock O
or O
a O
defective O
design B-AS
involving O
the O
intel B-AS
4000 I-AS
graphics I-AS
chipset I-AS
. O

Stop O
living O
in O
the O
stone O
age O
and O
buy O
a O
mac O
, O
you O
will O
not O
be O
sorry O
at O
all O
! O
! O

OSX B-AS
Mountain I-AS
Lion I-AS
soon O
to O
upgrade O
to O
Mavericks B-AS
. O

Apple O
hit O
a O
home O
run O
here O
. O

I O
just O
bought O
the O
new O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
the O
13 O
'' O
model O
, O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
Apple O
keeps O
making O
the O
same O
mistake O
with O
regard O
to O
USB B-AS
ports I-AS
. O

So O
glad O
I O
have O
gone O
this O
route O
! O
! O

It O
wakes B-AS
in O
less O
than O
a O
second O
when O
I O
open O
the O
lid B-AS
. O

It O
is O
the O
perfect O
size B-AS
and O
speed B-AS
for O
me O
. O

I O
am O
so O
addict O
to O
this O
laptop O
. O

THE O
CUSTOMER B-AS
SERVICE I-AS
IS O
TERRIFIC O
! O
! O

Trashed O
it O
when O
I O
spilled O
a O
latte O
on O
it O
while O
writing O
at O
a O
cafe O
. O

My O
last O
laptop O
was O
a O
17 O
'' O
ASUS O
gaming O
machine O
, O
which O
performed B-AS
admirably O
, O
but O
having O
since O
built O
my O
own O
desktop O
and O
really O
settling O
into O
the O
college O
life O
, O
I O
found O
myself O
wanting O
something O
smaller O
and O
less O
cumbersome O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
that O
the O
ASUS O
had O
been O
slowly O
developing O
problems O
ever O
since O
I O
bought O
it O
about O
4 O
years O
ago O
. O

However O
, O
it O
did O
not O
have O
any O
scratches O
, O
ZERO O
battery B-AS
cycle I-AS
count I-AS
( O
pretty O
surprised O
) O
, O
and O
all O
the O
hardware B-AS
seemed O
to O
be O
working O
perfectly O
. O

After O
fumbling O
around O
with O
the O
OS B-AS
I O
started O
searching O
the O
internet O
for O
a O
fix O
and O
found O
a O
number O
of O
forums O
on O
fixing O
the O
issue O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
be O
more O
pleased O
. O

And O
as O
for O
all O
the O
fancy O
finger B-AS
swipes I-AS
- O
- O
I O
just O
gave O
up O
and O
attached O
a O
mouse B-AS
. O

I O
needed O
a O
laptop O
with O
big O
storage B-AS
, O
a O
nice O
screen B-AS
and O
fast O
so O
I O
can O
photoshop B-AS
without O
any O
problem O
. O

I O
like O
coming O
back O
to O
Mac B-AS
OS I-AS
but O
this O
laptop O
is O
lacking O
in O
speaker B-AS
quality I-AS
compared O
to O
my O
$ O
400 O
old O
HP O
laptop O
. O

It O
is O
much O
better O
than O
the O
Acer O
ultrabook O
I O
had O
before O
. O

Shipped B-AS
very O
quickly O
and O
safely O
. O

I O
finally O
own O
a O
piece O
of O
computing O
equipment O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
take O
a O
baseball O
bat O
and O
destroy O
. O

The O
thunderbolt B-AS
port I-AS
is O
awesome O
! O

User O
friendly O
, O
fast O
and O
high O
tech O
It O
is O
amazing O
! O

The O
performance B-AS
is O
definitely O
superior O
to O
any O
computer O
I O
've O
ever O
put O
my O
hands O
on O
. O

It O
's O
great O
for O
streaming B-AS
video I-AS
and O
other O
entertainment B-AS
uses I-AS
. O

Apple O
did O
a O
great O
job O
. O

I O
like O
the O
design B-AS
and O
its O
features B-AS
but O
there O
are O
somethings O
I O
think O
needs O
to O
be O
improved O
. O

There O
were O
small O
problems O
with O
Mac B-AS
office I-AS
. O

It O
is O
extremely O
fast O
and O
very O
compact O
. O

I O
understand O
I O
should O
call O
Apple B-AS
Tech I-AS
Support I-AS
about O
any O
variables O
( O
which O
is O
my O
purpose O
of O
writing O
this O
con O
) O
as O
variables O
could O
be O
a O
bigger O
future O
problem O
. O

I O
ordered O
my O
2012 O
mac O
mini O
after O
being O
disappointed O
with O
spec B-AS
of O
the O
new O
27 O
'' O
Imacs O
. O

It O
still O
works B-AS
and O
it O
's O
extremely O
user O
friendly O
, O
so O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
for O
new O
computer O
user O
and O
also O
for O
those O
who O
are O
just O
looking O
for O
a O
more O
efficient O
way O
to O
do O
things O

Its O
fast O
, O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
and O
it O
looks B-AS
great O
. O

( O
but O
Office B-AS
can O
be O
purchased O
) O
IF O
I O
ever O
need O
a O
laptop O
again O
I O
am O
for O
sure O
purchasing O
another O
Toshiba O
! O
! O

I O
have O
n't O
tried O
the O
one O
with O
retina B-AS
display I-AS
... O
Maybe O
in O
the O
future O
. O

You O
can O
read O
all O
about O
the O
details O
of O
this O
marvelous O
computer O
on O
wikipedia O
. O

Performance B-AS
is O
much O
much O
better O
on O
the O
Pro O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
install O
an O
SSD B-AS
on O
it O
. O

Note O
, O
however O
, O
that O
any O
existing O
MagSafe B-AS
accessories I-AS
you O
have O
will O
not O
work O
with O
the O
MagSafe B-AS
2 I-AS
connection I-AS
. O

If O
you O
get O
a O
lemon O
( O
I O
have O
two O
thirds O
of O
my O
Macs O
) O
, O
you O
have O
to O
send O
it O
in O
for O
repairs O
several O
times O
before O
they O
will O
replace O
it O
, O
even O
if O
they O
have O
numerous O
problems O
with O
the O
same O
version O
of O
their O
computers O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
dislike O
is O
the O
touchpad B-AS
, O
alot O
of O
the O
times O
its O
unresponsive O
and O
does O
things O
I O
dont O
want O
it O
too O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
using O
a O
mouse B-AS
with O
it O
. O

Yeah O
, O
it O
's O
super O
expensive O
. O

The O
Mac O
mini O
is O
about O
8x O
smaller O
than O
my O
old O
computer O
which O
is O
a O
huge O
bonus O
and O
runs B-AS
very O
quiet O
, O
actually O
the O
fans B-AS
are O
n't O
audible O
unlike O
my O
old O
pc O

MAYBE O
The O
Mac B-AS
OS I-AS
improvement O
were O
not O
The O
product O
they O
Want O
to O
offer O
. O

It O
came O
before O
the O
day O
it O
supposed O
to O
which O
is O
great O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
transition O
would O
be O
difficult O
at O
best O
and O
would O
take O
some O
time O
to O
fully O
familiarize O
myself O
with O
the O
new O
Mac B-AS
ecosystem I-AS
. O

It O
's O
absolutely O
wonderful O
and O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
! O

It O
's O
a O
good O
fix O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

I O
am O
please O
with O
the O
products O
ease O
of O
use B-AS
; O
out O
of O
the O
box O
ready O
; O
appearance B-AS
and O
functionality B-AS
. O

Buying O
a O
Mac O
Mini O
would O
allow O
me O
to O
make O
the O
transition O
. O

Before O
I O
begin O
, O
I O
will O
say O
that O
I O
am O
not O
like O
a O
good O
percentage O
of O
the O
people O
that O
will O
end O
up O
writing O
a O
review O
on O
this O
computer O
- O
I O
am O
not O
an O
Apple O
fanboy O
. O

its O
by O
far O
faster O
and O
more O
stable O
then O
my O
PC O
. O

I O
purchased O
a O
MacBook O
Pro O
and O
this O
to O
replace O
a O
couple O
of O
HP O
units O
that O
I O
was O
using O
. O

you O
will O
not O
regret O
it O
, O
promise O
you O
! O

Moving O
from O
a O
PC O
to O
Mac O
has O
never O
been O
easier O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
glad O
that O
I O
did O
it O
. O

Perfect O
for O
all O
my O
graphic B-AS
design I-AS
classes O
I O
'm O
taking O
this O
year O
in O
college O
: O
- O
) O

Have O
used O
only O
Macs O
for O
years O
. O

Being O
a O
tech O
savvy O
, O
APPLE O
- O
product O
loving O
person O
, O
I O
'm O
glad O
I O
finally O
got O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
! O

I O
was O
always O
against O
them O
but O
now O
I O
buying O
one O
I O
'll O
never O
go O
back O
to O
PC O
. O

I O
will O
not O
be O
using O
that O
slot B-AS
again O
. O

I O
think O
that O
was O
a O
great O
decision O
to O
buy O

The O
OS B-AS
is O
fast O
and O
fluid O
, O
everything O
is O
organized O
and O
it O
's O
just O
beautiful O
. O

It O
will O
make O
life O
so O
much O
easier O
next O
semester O
, O
just O
wish O
I O
had O
it O
last O
semester O
! O
! O

I O
paid O
for O
a O
new O
laptop O
, O
but O
was O
sent O
a O
used O
one O
. O

Searched O
it O
on O
amazon O
and O
on O
bestbuy O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
one O
for O
my O
11 O
year O
old O
and O
the O
MacBook O
Air O
for O
my O
9 O
year O
old O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
for O
college O
and O
so O
far O
it O
's O
amazing O
! O

They O
are O
simpler O
to O
use B-AS
. O

It O
was O
at O
my O
door O
in O
less O
than O
24 O
hours O
. O

It O
's O
also O
very O
pricey O
but O
you O
just O
have O
to O
tell O
yourself O
it O
's O
an O
investment O
and O
that O
it O
's O
gon O
na O
last O
you O
a O
long O
time O
. O

It O
was O
getting O
old O
and O
I O
needed O
a O
new O
school O
computer O
. O

! O
so O
nice O
.. O
stable O
.. O
fast O
.. O
now O
i O
got O
my O
SSD B-AS
! O

I O
love O
apple O
but O
unlike O
others O
That O
does O
not O
prevent O
me O
to O
not O
be O
honest O
about O
how O
i O
like O
it O
and O
if O
its O
good O
or O
not O
. O

So O
, O
I O
'm O
cooled O
on O
Mac O
buys O
. O

It O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
for O
that O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
'm O
happy O
I O
switched O
. O

Also O
, O
in O
using O
the O
built B-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
camera I-AS
, O
my O
voice B-AS
recording I-AS
for O
my O
vlog O
sounds O
like O
the O
interplanetary O
transmissions O
in O
the O
`` O
Star O
Wars O
'' O
saga O
. O

Overall O
a O
nice O
computer O
. O

You O
can O
imagine O
that O
an O
expensive O
item O
as O
a O
laptop O
will O
not O
be O
left O
on O
your O
front O
steps O
, O
it O
needs O
signature O
to O
pove O
that O
you O
received O
it O
. O

I O
love O
the O
quick O
start B-AS
up I-AS
. O

Yes O
, O
he O
is O
a O
self O
professed O
`` O
Mac O
snob O
. O

You O
just O
can O
not O
beat O
the O
functionality B-AS
of O
an O
Apple O
device O
. O

Yet O
my O
mac O
continues O
to O
function B-AS
properly O
. O

Graphics B-AS
are O
much O
improved O
. O

Here O
are O
the O
things O
that O
made O
me O
confident O
with O
my O
purchase O
: O
Build B-AS
Quality I-AS
- O
Seriously O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
a O
unibody B-AS
construction I-AS
. O

It O
's O
the O
mid O
2012 O
version O
. O

It O
provides O
much O
more O
flexibility B-AS
for I-AS
connectivity I-AS
. O

I O
want O
the O
portability B-AS
of O
a O
tablet O
, O
without O
the O
limitations O
of O
a O
tablet O
and O
that O
's O
where O
this O
laptop O
comes O
into O
play O
. O

I O
have O
had O
many O
, O
many O
issues O
with O
PC O
's O
in O
the O
past O
and O
I O
'm O
finally O
glad O
to O
have O
joined O
the O
Mac O
revolution O
! O

Mac B-AS
tutorials I-AS
do O
help O
. O

When O
it O
broke O
I O
wanted O
another O
Acer O
and O
chose O
the O
V5 O
. O

The O
technical B-AS
support I-AS
was O
not O
helpful O
as O
well O
. O

I O
got O
the O
new O
adapter B-AS
and O
there O
was O
no O
change O
. O

so O
i O
called O
technical B-AS
support I-AS
. O

Nothing O
about O
it O
that O
i O
do O
n't O
love O
, O
apple O
always O
makes O
a O
great O
product O
. O

I O
saved O
about O
$ O
100 O
plus O
tax O
ordering O
on O
Amazon O
and O
since O
I O
have O
prime O
, O
it O
arrived O
overnight O
for O
just O
$ O
3.99 O
more O
. O

Came O
with O
iPhoto B-AS
and O
garage B-AS
band I-AS
already O
loaded O
. O

It O
's O
all O
a O
bit O
magical O
. O

Logic B-AS
board I-AS
utterly O
fried O
, O
cried O
, O
and O
laid O
down O
and O
died O
. O

It O
is O
BLAZING O
fast O
! O

The O
sound B-AS
was O
crappy O
even O
when O
you O
turn O
up O
the O
volume B-AS
still O
the O
same O
results O
. O

ive O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
it O
! O

I O
currently O
own O
a O
Lenovo O
laptop O
as O
well O
as O
my O
new O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
and O
each O
have O
their O
own O
strengths O
and O
weaknesses O
. O

OSX B-AS
Lion I-AS
is O
a O
great O
performer..extremely O
fast O
and O
reliable O
. O

Best O
commuter O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O

What O
can O
I O
say O
, O
It O
's O
an O
Apple O
. O

Having O
heard O
from O
friends O
and O
family O
about O
how O
reliable O
a O
Mac O
product O
is O
, O
I O
never O
expected O
to O
have O
an O
application B-AS
crash O
within O
the O
first O
month O
, O
but O
I O
did O
. O

The O
Macbook O
pro O
's O
physical B-AS
form I-AS
is O
wonderful O
. O

I O
have O
an O
iPhone O
, O
and O
iPad O
, O
so O
it O
just O
made O
sense O
to O
finish O
off O
the O
platform O
by O
adding O
the O
Mini O
. O

Not O
super O
light O
but O
still O
a O
good O
one O
. O

The O
Mini O
's O
body B-AS
has O
n't O
changed O
since O
late O
2010 O
- O
and O
for O
a O
good O
reason O
. O

The O
unibody B-AS
construction I-AS
really O
does O
feel O
lot O
more O
solid O
than O
Apple O
's O
previous O
laptops O
. O

i O
had O
to O
return O
it O
for O
a O
replacement O
. O

It O
was O
wonderful O
deal O
for O
the O
wonderful O
product O
. O

It O
completely O
supports O
my O
home O
business O
and O
personal O
life O
. O

3D B-AS
rendering I-AS
slows O
it O
down O
considerably O
. O

Got O
this O
Mac O
Mini O
with O
OS B-AS
X I-AS
Mountain I-AS
Lion I-AS
for O
my O
wife O
. O

I O
am O
pleased O
to O
report O
that O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
presents O
I O
have O
received O
to O
date O
. O

Every O
day O
I O
had O
this O
computer O
, O
something O
failed O
on O
it O
. O

fast O
, O
great O
screen B-AS
, O
beautiful O
apps B-AS
for O
a O
laptop O
; O
priced B-AS
at O
1100 O
on O
the O
apple O
website O
; O
amazon O
had O
it O
for O
1098+ O
tax O
- O
plus O
i O
had O
a O
10 O

from O

me O
998 O
plus O
tax O
- O
1070 O
- O
OTD O
! O

12.44 O
seconds O
to O
boot B-AS
. O

All O
the O
ports B-AS
are O
much O
needed O
since O
this O
is O
my O
main O
computer O
. O

The O
Like O
New O
condition O
of O
the O
iMac O
MC309LL O
/ O
A O
on O
Amazon O
is O
at O
$ O
900+ O
level O
only O
, O
and O
it O
is O
a O
Quad B-AS
- I-AS
Core I-AS
2.5 I-AS
GHz I-AS
CPU I-AS
( O
similar O
to O
the O
$ O

Mini O
) O

with O
Radeon B-AS
HD I-AS
6750M I-AS
512MB I-AS

( O
this O
mini O
is O
integrated B-AS

) O
, O
and O
it O
even O
comes O
with O
wireless B-AS
Apple I-AS
Keyboard I-AS
and I-AS
Mouse I-AS
, O
all O
put O
together O
in O
neat O
and O
nice O
package B-AS
. O

Put O
a O
cover B-AS
on O
it O
and O
is O
a O
little O
better O
but O
that O
is O
my O
only O
complaint O
. O

Within O
a O
few O
hours O
I O
was O
using O
the O
gestures B-AS
unconsciously O
. O

This O
mac O
does O
come O
with O
an O
extender B-AS
cable I-AS
and O
I O
'm O
using O
mine O
right O
now O
hoping O
the O
cable B-AS
will O
stay O
nice O
for O
the O
many O
years O
I O
plan O
on O
using O
this O
mac O
. O

This O
is O
the O
third O
in O
a O
series O
of O
MacBooks O
starting O
with O
a O
Black O
MacBook O
. O

The O
2.9ghz B-AS
dual I-AS
- I-AS
core I-AS
i7 I-AS
chip I-AS
really O
out O
does O
itself O
. O

My O
life O
has O
been O
enriched O
since O
I O
have O
been O
using O
Apple O
products O
. O

i O
FINALLY O
DID O
IT O
AND O
THIS O
MACHINE O
IS O
THE O
WAY O
TO O
GO O
! O

It O
is O
pretty O
snappy O
and O
starts B-AS
up I-AS
in O
about O
30 O
seconds O
which O
is O
good O
enough O
for O
me O
. O

The O
few O
things O
that O
are O
wrong O
with O
it O
are O
very O
minor O
things O
. O

So O
noise B-AS
is O
reduced O
at O
least O
50 O
% O
and O
the O
heat B-AS
is O
much O
better O
, O
now O
it O
does O
n't O
feel O
hot O
but O
warm O
. O

Not O
sure O
on O
Windows B-AS
8 I-AS
. O

It O
's O
a O
lottery O
at O
this O
point O
as O
I O
have O
read O
that O
other O
have O
received O
new O
ones O
with O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

My O
one O
complaint O
is O
that O
there O
was O
no O
internal B-AS
CD I-AS
drive I-AS
. O

This O
newer O
netbook O
has O
no O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
or O
network B-AS
lights I-AS
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
for O
me O
to O
use O
a O
Mac O
and O
I O
'm O
really O
happy O
with O
the O
move O
. O

No O
complaints O
for O
an O
Apple O
product O
. O

The O
new O
MacBook O
is O
lightyears O
ahead O
of O
my O
old O
white O
plastic O
MacBook O
circa O
2006 O
. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
85 O
% O
of O
the O
design O
industry O
is O
Mac O
for O
good O
reason O
. O

I O
was O
having O
a O
though O
time O
deciding O
between O
the O
13 O
'' O
MacBook O
Air O
or O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
13 O
'' O
( O
Both O
baseline O
models O
, O
priced B-AS
at O
1,200 O
$ O
retail O
) O

The O
last O
new O
mac O
I O
bought O
was O
in O
1998 O
. O

There O
are O
reviews O
that O
speak O
to O
a O
few O
possible O
glitches O
but O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
seen O
them O
yet O
. O

Not O
too O
expense O
and O
has O
enough O
storage B-AS
for O
most O
users O
and O
many O
ports B-AS
. O

I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
with O
the O
mini O
. O

The O
audio B-AS
volume I-AS
is O
quite O
low O
and O
virtually O
unusable O
in O
a O
room O
with O
any O
background O
activity O
. O

I O
am O
going O
to O
college O
next O
year O
and O
I O
needed O
a O
cheaper O
, O
quality O
computer O
for O
the O
goals O
I O
am O
trying O
to O
pursue O
. O

In O
the O
short O
time O
of O
one O
month O
since O
the O
2012 O
Mac O
Mini O
was O
released O
there O
are O
well O
over O
1000 O
posts O
regarding O
this O
issue O
and O
the O
numbers O
keep O
rising O
. O

It O
is O
lightweight O
and O
the O
perfect O
size B-AS
to O
carry O
to O
class O
. O

If O
you O
have O
to O
ask O
you O
do O
n't O
own O
a O
Mac O
and O
your O
just O
not O
in O
the O
know O
. O

All O
my O
devises O
“ O
talk O
” O
to O
each O
other O
. O

Why O
not O
5 O
stars O
? O

Very O
Very O
Highly O
Recommended O

I O
am O
only O
interested O
in O
the O

McBook O

A O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
I O
did O
n't O
make O
the O
switch O
sooner O
... O
o O
ya O
because O
it O
's O
expensive O
. O

I O
was O
given O
a O
demonstration O
of O
Windows B-AS
8 I-AS
. O

The O
Macbook O
Pro O
is O
the O
premier O
choice O
for O
college O
students O
. O

Their O
products O
, O
including O
the O
MBP O
, O
are O
beautiful O
, O
sleek O
and O
clever O
. O

The O
MBP O
is O
beautiful O
has O
many O
wonderful O
capabilities B-AS
. O

I O
thought O
that O
it O
will O
be O
fine O
, O
if O
i O
do O
some O
settings B-AS
. O

Runs B-AS
very O
smoothly O
. O

Perfect- O
- O
thanks O
so O
. O

Also O
, O
it O
hardly O
ever O
crashes O
. O

I O
was O
so O
excited O
to O
get O
this O
in O
the O
mail O
i O
nearly O
gave O
myself O
a O
heart O
attack O
. O

Boot B-AS
- I-AS
up I-AS
slowed O
significantly O
after O
all O
Windows B-AS
updates I-AS
were O
installed O
. O

More O
likely O
it O
will O
require O
replacing O
the O
logic B-AS
board I-AS
once O
they O
admit O
they O
have O
a O
problem O
and O
come O
up O
with O
a O
solution O
. O

When O
i O
finally O
held O
it O
in O
my O
hands O
i O
kissed O
it O
, O
yes O
i O
did O
. O

It O
was O
important O
that O
it O
was O
powerful O
enough O
to O
do O
all O
of O
the O
tasks O
he O
needed O
on O
the O
internet B-AS
, O
word B-AS
processing I-AS
, O
graphic B-AS
design I-AS
and O
gaming B-AS
. O

This O
computer O
is O
not O
cheap O
and O
represent O
an O
achievement O
for O
me O
. O

I O
like O
the O
Mini O
Mac O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
setup B-AS
and O
install B-AS
, O
but O
I O
am O
learning O
as O
I O
go O
and O
could O
use O
a O
tutorial B-AS
to O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
some O
of O
the O
features B-AS
I O
was O
use O
to O
on O
the O
PC O
especially O
the O
right B-AS
mouse I-AS
click I-AS
menu I-AS
. O

GET O
THIS O
MACHINE O

It O
's O
shiny O
and O
it O
's O
pretty O
. O

Runs B-AS
real O
quick O
. O

All O
the O
above O
aside O
this O
machine O
ROCKS O
! O

Buy O
the O
separate O
RAM B-AS
memory I-AS
and O
you O
will O
have O
a O
rocket O
! O

Since O
the O
machine O
's O
slim O
profile B-AS
is O
critical O
to O
me O
, O
that O
was O
a O
problem O
. O

Bottom O
line O
, O
if O
you O
can O
afford O
it O
, O
get O
a O
Mac O
! O

I O
finally O
made O
the O
leap O
after O
my O
Gateway O
crapped O
out O
on O
me O
. O

WiFi B-AS
capability I-AS
, O
disk B-AS
drive I-AS
and O
multiple O
USB B-AS
ports I-AS
to O
connect O
scale O
and O
printers O
was O
all O
that O
was O
required O
. O

The O
SD B-AS
card I-AS
reader I-AS
is O
slightly O
recessed O
and O
upside O
down O
( O
the O
nail B-AS
slot I-AS
on I-AS
the I-AS
card I-AS
can O
not O
be O
accessed O
) O
, O
if O
this O
was O
a O
self O
ejecting O
slot B-AS
this O
would O
not O
be O
an O
issue O
, O
but O
its O
not O
. O

Soft O
touch B-AS
, O
anodized B-AS
aluminum I-AS
with O
laser O
cut O
precision O
and O
no O
flaws O
. O

Simple O
details O
, O
crafted O
aluminium B-AS
and O
real O
glass B-AS
make O
this O
laptop O
blow O
away O
the O
other O
plastic O
ridden O
, O
bulky O
sticker O
filled O
laptops O
. O

First O
of O
all O
yes O
this O
is O
a O
mac O
and O
it O
has O
that O
nice O
brushed O
aluminum B-AS
. O

Who O
makes O
a O
laptop O
that O
ca O
n't O
rest O
on O
your O
lap O
? O

After O
all O
was O
said O
and O
done O
, O
I O
essentially O
used O
that O
$ O
450 O
savings O
to O
buy O
16GB B-AS
of I-AS
RAM I-AS
, O
TWO O
Seagate B-AS
Momentus I-AS
XT I-AS
hybrid I-AS
drives I-AS
and O
an O
OWC B-AS
upgrade I-AS
kit I-AS
to O
install O
the O
second O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
. O

The O
Dell O
Inspiron O
is O
fast O
and O
has O
a O
number B-AS
pad I-AS
on I-AS
the I-AS
keyboard I-AS
, O
which O
I O
miss O
on O
my O
Apple O
laptops O
. O

wow O
the O
new O
macbook O
pro O
hanged O
as O
i O
tried O
to O
type O
this O
review O
. O

The O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
a O
great O
product O
which O
can O
meet O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
average O
consumer O
. O

I O
was O
concerned O
that O
the O
downgrade O
to O
the O
regular B-AS
hard I-AS
drive I-AS
would O
make O
it O
unacceptably O
slow O
but O
I O
need O
not O
have O
worried O
- O
this O
machine O
is O
the O
fastest O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
... O

This O
one O
still O
has O
the O
CD B-AS
slot I-AS
. O

No O
HDMI B-AS
port I-AS
. O

I O
had O
to O
install B-AS
Mountain I-AS
Lion I-AS
and O
it O
took O
a O
good O
two O
hours O
. O

Customization B-AS
on O
mac O
is O
impossible O
. O

I O
hope O
this O
review O
helps O
. O

However O
, O
you O
have O
to O
adjust O
yourself O
to O
what O
it O
will O
do O
, O
not O
what O
you O
want O
it O
to O
do O
. O

I O
am O
replacing O
the O
HD B-AS
with O
a O
Micron B-AS
SSD I-AS
soon O
. O

Plus O
two B-AS
finger I-AS
clicking I-AS
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
the O
right B-AS
click I-AS
button I-AS
is O
surprisingly O
intuitive O
. O

Far O
superior O
to O
my O
MacBook O
. O

The O
SuperDrive B-AS
is O
quiet O
. O

It O
was O
quite O
easy O
. O

The O
power B-AS
plug I-AS
has O
to O
be O
connected O
to O
the O
power B-AS
adaptor I-AS
to O
charge O
the O
battery B-AS
but O
wo O
n't O
stay O
connected O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
buy O
a O
few O
notebooks O
for O
my O
nephews O
for O
Xmas O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
was O
completely O
dead O
, O
in O
fact O
it O
had O
grown O
about O
a O
quarter O
inch O
thick O
lump O
on O
the O
underside O
. O

This O
is O
no O
exception O
. O

if O
yo O
like O
practicality B-AS
this O
is O
the O
laptop O
for O
you O
. O

The O
OS B-AS
is O
great O
. O

I O
have O
had O
a O
black O
macbook O
since O
2007 O
. O

I O
tried O
several O
monitors B-AS
and O
several O
HDMI B-AS
cables I-AS
and O
this O
was O
the O
case O
each O
time O
. O

CONS O
: O
Price B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
ridiculous O
, O
kinda O
heavy O
. O

If O
that O
is O
the O
case O
, O
then O
I O
am O
completely O
happy O

10/ O
10 O
five O
stars O
would O
recommend O
. O

The O
troubleshooting O
said O
it O
was O
the O
AC B-AS
adaptor I-AS
so O
we O
ordered O
a O
new O
one O
. O

I O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
my O
machine O
, O
and O
it O
was O
pampered O
. O

Fan B-AS
only O
comes O
on O
when O
you O
are O
playing B-AS
a I-AS
game I-AS
. O

Which O
it O
did O
not O
have O
, O
only O
3 O
USB B-AS
2 I-AS
ports I-AS
. O

No O
startup B-AS
disk I-AS
was O
not O
included O
but O
that O
may O
be O
my O
fault O
. O

There O
is O
no O
`` B-AS
tools I-AS
'' I-AS
menu I-AS
. O

It O
is O
very O
fast O
and O
has O
everything O
that O
I O
need O
except O
for O
a O
word B-AS
program I-AS
. O

Needs O
a O
CD B-AS
/ I-AS
DVD I-AS
drive I-AS
and O
a O
bigger O
power B-AS
switch I-AS
. O

It O
is O
the O
best O
laptop O
ever O
! O
! O
! O

My O
laptop O
with O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
crashed O
and O
I O
did O
not O
want O
Windows B-AS
8 I-AS
. O

Was O
skeptical O
about O
buying O
an O
electronic O
item O
online O
but O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
positive O
experience O
. O

Not O
a O
scratch O
or O
mark O
on O
it O
. O

Easy O
to O
install B-AS
also O
small O
to O
leave O
anywhere O
at O
your O
bedroom O
also O
very O
easy O
to O
configure B-AS
for I-AS
ADSl I-AS
cable I-AS
or I-AS
wifi I-AS
. O

Words O
can O
not O
express O
how O
much O
I O
love O
my O
new O
Mac O
. O

The O
speakers B-AS
could O
have O
been O
better O
but O
it O
was O
n't O
a O
deal O
breaker O
... O
this O
is O
a O
great O
little O
laptop O
... O
love O
it O
! O

The O
item O
received O
was O
exactly O
as O
identified O
. O

Its O
everything O
mac O
offers O
. O

Nice O
packing B-AS
. O

Besides O
being O
elegant O
, O
the O
MacBooks O
are O
durable O
. O

I O
switched O
to O
this O
because O
I O
wanted O
something O
different O
, O
even O
though O
I O
miss O
windows B-AS
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
MBP O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
competing O
PC O
laptops O
. O

Apple O
no O
longer O
includes O
iDVD B-AS
with O
the O
computer O
and O
furthermore O
, O
Apple O
does O
n't O
even O
offer O
it O
anymore O
! O

I O
also O
wanted O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
, O
which O
this O
one O
has O
. O

At O
first O
, O
I O
feel O
a O
little O
bit O
uncomfortable O
in O
using O
the O
Mac B-AS
system I-AS
. O

I O
am O
used O
to O
computers O
with O
windows B-AS
so O
I O
am O
having O
a O
little O
difficulty O
finding O
my O
way O
around O
. O

They O
replaced O
it O
and O
so O
far O
so O
good O
. O

It O
just O
works B-AS
out O
of O
the O
box O
and O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
cool O
software B-AS
included O
with O
the O
OS B-AS
. O

Good O
in O
every O
aspect O
. O

its O
as O
advertised O
on O
here O
... O
.. O
it O
works B-AS
great O
and O
is O
not O
a O
waste O
of O
money O
! O

Replaced O
this O
one O
with O
my O
mac O
that O
was O
stolen O
, O
its O
a O
great O
computer O
. O

Just O
be O
careful O
; O
you O
always O
have O
to O
give O
up O
some O
good O
stuff O
for O
others O
. O

Runs B-AS
like O
a O
champ O
... O
.. O

Really O
great O
... O
Well O
let O
me O
start O
at O
the O
beginning O
. O

Premium O
price B-AS
for O
the O
OS B-AS
more O
than O
anything O
else O
. O

This O
was O
a O
gift O
for O
my O
grand O
son O
. O

I O
was O
a O
little O
concerned O
about O
the O
touch B-AS
pad I-AS
based O
on O
reviews O
, O
but O
I O
've O
found O
it O
fine O
to O
work O
with O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
Mac O
book O
pro O
along O
with O
a O
new O
27 O
'' O
iMac O
and O
while O
they O
are O
still O
light O
years O
more O
reliable O
than O
a O
PC O
I O
have O
noticed O
a O
decline O
in O
the O
reliability B-AS
of O
my O
Mac O
computers O
. O

The O
sound B-AS
as O
mentioned O
earlier O
is O
n't O
the O
best O
, O
but O
it O
can O
be O
solved O
with O
headphones B-AS
. O

The O
track B-AS
pad I-AS
is O
a O
bit O
squirrely O
at O
times O
- O
sometimes O
too O
sensitive O
, O
and O
sometimes O
a O
bit O
unresponsive O
, O
but O
it O
's O
usable O
. O

However O
, O
the O
experience O
was O
great O
since O
the O
OS B-AS
does O
not O
become O
unstable O
and O
the O
application B-AS
will O
simply O
shutdown O
and O
reopen O
. O

Then O
only O
FOUR O
months O
later O
, O
my O
great O
MacBook O
pro O
FAILED O
. O

If O
you O
ask O
me O
, O
for O
this O
price B-AS
it O
should O
be O
included O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
is O
not O
as O
shown O
in O
the O
product O
photos O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
could O
have O
gotten O
a O
pc O
twice O
the O
speed B-AS
for O
the O
same O
price B-AS
I O
still O
think O
there O
's O
nothing O
like O
a O
Mac O
. O

Seems O
a O
much O
more O
economical O
way O
to O
get O
into O
Apple O
than O
their O
other O
computers O
. O

Shipping B-AS
was O
quick O
and O
product O
described O
was O
the O
product O
sent O
and O
so O
much O
more O
... O

I O
'm O
so O
disgusted O
that O
I O
wasted O
my O
money O
on O
this O
product O
. O

All O
you O
get O
is O
a O
box O
and O
a O
computer O
. O

the O
retina B-AS
display I-AS
display I-AS
make O
pictures O
i O
took O
years O
ago O
jaw O
dropping O
. O

Its O
only O
crashed O
on O
me O
one O
time O
in O
the O
3 O
months O
i O
've O
had O
it O
. O

The O
Mac O
Mini O
is O
probably O
the O
simplest O
example O
of O
compact B-AS
computing I-AS
out O
there O
. O

Instead O
, O
I O
'll O
focus O
more O
on O
the O
actual O
performance B-AS
and I-AS
feature I-AS
set I-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
hardware I-AS
itself O
so O
you O
can O
make O
an O
educated O
decision O
on O
which O
Mac O
to O
buy O
. O

My O
bag O
just O
got O
a O
little O
lighter O
. O

I O
'm O
Not O
exagerating O
when O
I O
say O
this O
computer O
is O
perfect..i O
It O
is O
! O
! O

This O
machine O
is O
flawless O
, O
fast O
, O
and O
classy O
. O

Other O
ports B-AS
include O
FireWire B-AS
800 I-AS
, O
Gigabit B-AS

I O
stayed O
up O
half O
the O
night O
enjoying O
my O
new O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
a O
100 O
times O
better O
than O
a O
Chromebook O
! O

Additionally O
, O
there O
is O
barely O
a O
ventilation B-AS
system I-AS
in O
the O
computer O
, O
and O
even O
the O
simple O
activity O
of O
watching B-AS
videos I-AS
let O
alone O
playing B-AS
steam I-AS
games I-AS
causes O
the O
laptop O
to O
get O
very O
very O
hot O
, O
and O
in O
fact O
impossible O
to O
keep O
on O
lap O
. O

At O
$ O
1899 O
to O
start O
, O
this O
is O
no O
cheap O
machine O
. O

Chatting O
with O
Acer B-AS
support I-AS
, O
I O
was O
advised O
the O
problem O
was O
corrupted O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
files I-AS
. O

It O
's O
been O
a O
couple O
weeks O
since O
the O
purchase O
and O
I O
'm O
struggle O
with O
finding O
the O
correct O
keys B-AS
( O
but O
that O
was O
expected O
) O
. O

Many O
people O
complain O
about O
the O
new O
OS B-AS
, O
and O
it O
's O
urgent O
for O
Apple O
to O
fix O
it O
asap O
! O

Now O
that O
I O
have O
upgraded O
to O
Lion B-AS
I O
am O
much O
happier O
about O
MAC B-AS
OS I-AS
and O
have O
just O
bought O
an O
iMac O
for O
office O
. O

User O
upgradeable O
RAM B-AS
and O
HDD B-AS
. O

But O
I O
wanted O
the O
Pro O
for O
the O
CD B-AS
/ I-AS
DVD I-AS
player I-AS
. O

I O
might O
have O
read O
it O
incorrectly O
, O
but O
better O
safe O
than O
sorry O
right O
? O

The O
ultimate O
graduation O
gift O
. O

The O
RAM B-AS
memory I-AS
is O
good O
but O
should O
have O
splurged O
for O
8Mb O
instead O
of O
4Mb O
. O

was O
debating O
to O
buy O
one O
for O
months O
, O
checked O
out O
different O
stuff O
on O
youtube O
, O
and O
read O
different O
articles O
and O
debates O
, O
I O
just O
didnt O
really O
wan O
na O
spend O
the O
money O
but O
Im O
glad O
that O
I O
did O
. O

I O
love O
it O
and O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O
who O
is O
tired O
of O
the O
constant O
attention O
PC O
's O
require O
. O

I O
was O
a O
little O
worry O
at O
first O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
experience O
with O
os.x B-AS
and O
windows B-AS
has O
always O
been O
second O
nature O
to O
me O
after O
many O
years O
of O
using O
windows B-AS
. O

I O
am O
an O
Info O
Sys O
major O
in O
college O
, O
so O
I O
started O
researching O
this O
issue O
on O
my O
own O
. O

Solution O
: O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
pretty O
simple O
. O

With O
the O
softwares B-AS
supporting O
the O
use O
of O
other O
OS B-AS
makes O
it O
much O
better O
. O

Still O
have O
n't O
solved O
this O
. O

I O
then O
upgraded O
to O
Mac B-AS
OS I-AS
X I-AS
10.8 I-AS
`` I-AS
Mountain I-AS
Lion I-AS
'' I-AS
. O

It O
is O
EXTREMELY O
fast O
and O
never O
lags O
. O

I O
told O
them O
that O
I O
just O
received O
my O
brand O
new O
MacBook O
but O
I O
was O
having O
issues O
. O

I O
was O
considering O
buying O
the O
Air O
, O
but O
in O
reality O
, O
this O
one O
has O
a O
more O
powerful O
performance B-AS
and O
seems O
much O
more O
convenient O
, O
even O
though O
it O
's O
about O
.20 O
inch O
thicker O
and O
2 O
lbs O
heavier O
. O

At O
home O
and O
the O
office O
it O
gets O
plugged O
into O
an O
external B-AS
24 I-AS
'' I-AS
LCD I-AS
screen I-AS
, O
so O
built B-AS
in I-AS
screen I-AS
size I-AS
is O
not O
terribly O
important O
. O

Hopefully O
my O
replacement O
is O
brand O
new O
. O

Just O
beware O
no O
DVD B-AS
slot I-AS
so O
when O
I O
went O
to O
install B-AS
software I-AS
I O
had O
on O
CD O
I O
could O
n't O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
to O
be O
able O
to O
dedicate O
a O
small O
, O
portable O
laptop O
to O
my O
writing O
and O
was O
surprised O
to O
learn O
that O
I O
needed O
to O
buy O
a O
word B-AS
processing I-AS
program I-AS
to O
do O
so O
. O

This O
version O
of O
MacBook O
Pro O
runs O
on O
a O
third B-AS
- I-AS
generation I-AS
CPU I-AS
( I-AS
`` I-AS
Ivy I-AS
Bridge I-AS
'' I-AS
) I-AS
, O
not O
the O
latest O
fourth B-AS
- I-AS
generation I-AS
Haswell I-AS
CPU I-AS
the O
2013 O
version O
has O
. O

Actually O
, O
I O
think O
I O
was O
intimidated O
by O
the O
change O
from O
a O
PC O
. O

No O
Cd B-AS
Rom I-AS
in O
the O
new O
version O
there O
's O
no O
way O
I O
'm O
spending O
that O
kind O
of O
money O
on O
something O
has O
less O
features B-AS
than O
the O
older O
version O
. O

Definitely O
worth O
spending O
the O
money O
on O
it O
. O

I O
have O
three O
words O
: O
Piece O
of O
Junk O
! O

the O
volume B-AS
is O
really O
low O
to O
low O
for O
a O
laptopwas O
not O
expectin O
t O
volume B-AS
to O
be O
so O
lowan O
i O
hate O
that O
about O
this O
computer O

Fits O
all O
my O
personal O
needs O
. O

I O
'm O
the O
pro- O
active O
type O
so O
I O
went O
off O
and O
did O
some O
preventative O
fixes O
. O

and O
its O
not O
hard O
to O
accidentally O
bang O
it O
against O
something O
so O
i O
recommend O
getting O
a O
case B-AS
to O
protect O
it O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
explore O
what O
the O
Mac O
was O
all O
about O
. O

I O
got O
this O
at O
an O
amazing O
price B-AS
from O
Amazon O
and O
it O
arrived O
just O
in O
time O
. O

Every O
time O
I O
log B-AS
into I-AS
the I-AS
system I-AS
after O
a O
few O
hours O
, O
there O
is O
this O
endlessly O
frustrating O
process O
that O
I O
have O
to O
go O
through O
. O

The O
majority O
of O
the O
reviews O
seem O
to O
be O
for O
the O
13.3 O
MacBook O
Pro O
Model O
# O
MD101LL/ O
A O
. O

Put O
a O
SSD B-AS
and O
use O
a O
21 B-AS
'' I-AS
LED I-AS
screen I-AS
, O
this O
set B-AS
up I-AS
is O
silky O
smooth O
! O

I O
saw O
the O
bad O
reviews O
from O
people O
saying O
to O
buy O
directly O
from O
Apple O
and O
I O
was O
concerned O
but O
I O
took O
my O
chances O
and O
am O
overly O
impressed O
. O

The O
case B-AS
is O
now O
slightly O
larger O
than O
the O
previous O
generation O
, O
but O
the O
lack O
of O
an O
external B-AS
power I-AS
supply I-AS
justifies O
the O
small O
increase O
in O
size B-AS
. O

I O
had O
to O
buy O
a O
wireless B-AS
mouse I-AS
to O
go O
with O
it O
, O
as O
I O
am O
old O
school O
and O
hate O
the O
pad B-AS
, O
but O
knew O
that O
before O
I O
bought O
it O
, O
now O
it O
works B-AS
great O
, O
need O
to O
get O
adjusted O
to O
the O
key B-AS
board I-AS
, O
as O
I O
am O
used O
to O
a O
bigger O
one O
and O
pounding O
. O

When O
considering O
a O
Mac O
, O
look O
at O
the O
total O
cost B-AS
of I-AS
ownership I-AS
and O
not O
just O
the O
initial O
price B-AS
tag I-AS
. O

Has O
all O
the O
other O
features B-AS
I O
wanted O
including O
a O
VGA B-AS
port I-AS
, O
HDMI B-AS
, O
ethernet B-AS
and O
3 O
USB B-AS
ports I-AS
. O

A O
great O
college O
tool O
! O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
dislike O
about O
this O
laptop O
are O
the O
rubber B-AS
pads I-AS
found O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
computer O
for O
grip O
. O

I O
called O
apple O
and O
no O
solution O
. O

It O
's O
a O
decent O
computer O
for O
the O
price B-AS
and O
hopefully O
it O
will O
last O
a O
long O
time O
. O

I O
was O
really O
happy O
because O
it O
is O
a O
much O
better O
price B-AS
on O
amazon.com O
than O
it O
was O
in O
the O
Mac O
store O
. O

The O
worst O
a O
Mac O
ever O
did O
to O
me O
was O
freeze O
up O
. O

The O
nicest O
part O
is O
the O
low O
heat B-AS
output I-AS
and O
ultra O
quiet O
operation B-AS
. O

I O
am O
paying O
apple O
to O
kill O
my O
self O
and O
my O
wallet O
. O

NO O
STAR O
FOR O
THIS O
TRASH O
. O
[ O
... O

I O
will O
upgrade B-AS
the I-AS
ram I-AS
myself O
( O
because O
with O
this O
model O
you O
can O
you O
can O
do O
it O
) O
later O
on O
. O

The O
price B-AS
is O
200 O
dollars O
down O
. O

this O
Mac O
Mini O
does O
not O
have O
a O
built B-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
mic I-AS
, O
and O
it O
would O
seem O
that O
its O
Mac B-AS
OS I-AS
10.9 I-AS
does O
not O
handle O
external B-AS
microphones I-AS
properly O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
features B-AS
and O
shortcuts B-AS
on O
the O
MBP O
that O
I O
was O
never O
exposed O
to O
on O
a O
normal O
PC O
. O

Was O
n't O
sure O
if O
I O
was O
going O
to O
like O
it O
much O
less O
love O
it O
so O
I O
went O
to O
a O
local O
best O
buy O
and O
played O
around O
with O
the O
IOS B-AS
system I-AS
on O
a O
Mac O
Pro O
and O
it O
was O
totally O
unique O
and O
different O
. O

Quietest O
laptop O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O

air O
has O
higher O
resolution B-AS
but O
the O
fonts B-AS
are O
small O
. O

again O
this O
is O
just O
my O
personal O
honest O
opinion O
. O

If O
you O
have O
much O
higher O
expectations O
than O
that O
... O
I O
would O
look O
elsewhere O
. O

working B-AS
with O
Mac O
is O
so O
much O
easier O
, O
so O
many O
cool O
features B-AS
. O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
buy O
a O
logitevh O
c270 O
. O

Very O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O

I O
like O
the O
brightness B-AS
and O
adjustments B-AS
. O

I O
'M O
SO O
HAPPY O
WITH O
MY O
macbook O
pro O
! O

I O
only O
wish O
this O
mac O
had O
a O
CD B-AS
/ I-AS
DVD I-AS
player I-AS
built O
in O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
miss O
is O
that O
my O
old O
Alienware O
laptop O
had O
backlit B-AS
keys I-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
miss O
are O
the O
`` B-AS
Home I-AS
/ I-AS
End I-AS
'' I-AS
type I-AS
keys I-AS
and O
other O
things O
that O
I O
grew O
accustomed O
to O
after O
so O
long O
. O

So O
happy O
with O
this O
purchase O
, O
I O
just O
wish O
it O
came O
with O
Microsoft B-AS
Word I-AS
. O

It O
is O
more O
than O
enough O
computer O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
needs O
of O
a O
high O
school O
student O
. O

It O
has O
enough O
memory B-AS
and O
speed B-AS
to O
run O
my O
business O
with O
all O
the O
flexibility B-AS
that O
comes O
with O
a O
laptop O
. O

The O
speed B-AS
, O
the O
simplicity B-AS
, O
the O
design B-AS
.. O
it O
is O
lightyears O
ahead O
of O
any O
PC O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O

I O
love O
everything O
about O
this O
computer O
. O

I O
found O
it O
toughest O
to O
decide O
between O
Dell O
ultra O
books O
and O
Apple O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
display B-AS
is O
excellent O
, O
and O
downloading B-AS
apps I-AS
is O
a O
breeze O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
, O
the O
software B-AS
and O
the O
smoothness O
of O
the O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
. O

While O
we O
struggle O
with O
all O
the O
crashes O
and O
viruses O
, O
the O
kids O
computers O
stay O
consistent O
and O
so O
we O
caved O
in O
and O
bought O
one O
for O
buisness O
! O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
RUN O
a O
computer O
; O
I O
want O
to O
USE O
a O
computer O
. O

i O
have O
dropped O
mine O
a O
couple O
times O
with O
only O
a O
slim B-AS
plastic I-AS
case I-AS
covering O
it O
. O

I O
also O
made O
a O
recovery B-AS
USB I-AS
stick I-AS
. O

Being O
a O
PC O
user O
for O
many O
years O
to O
switch O
to O
a O
Mac O
I O
will O
not O
go O
back O
. O

But O
with O
this O
laptop O
, O
the O
bass B-AS
is O
very O
weak O
and O
the O
sound B-AS
comes O
out O
sounding O
tinny O
. O

I O
do O
admit O
it O
is O
pricey O
but O
the O
saying O
is O
really O
true O
with O
this O
MacBook O
Pro O
Laptop O
( O
You O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
) O
. O

I O
've O
almost O
have O
bought O
every O
generation O
of O
MacMinis O
since O
2005 O
, O
and O
this O
one O
has O
n't O
let O
me O
down O
. O

The O
built B-AS
quality I-AS
is O
really O
good O
, O
I O
was O
so O
Happy O
and O
excited O
about O
this O
Product O
. O

I O
am O
loving O
the O
fast O
performance B-AS
also O
. O

I O
had O
to O
return O
it O
because O
it O
would O
n't O
even O
start O
. O

Further O
, O
this O
Mac O
Mini O
has O
a O
sloppy O
Bluetooth B-AS
interface I-AS
( O
courtesy O
of O
the O
Mac B-AS
OS I-AS
) O
and O
the O
range B-AS
is O
poor O
. O

Great O
deal O
on O
an O
amazing O
lap O
top O
! O

If O
you O
start O
on O
the O
far O
right O
side O
and O
scroll O
to O
your O
left O
the O
start B-AS
menu I-AS
will O
automatically O
come O
up O
. O

Best O
money O
I O
ever O
spent O
. O

My O
only O
gripe O
would O
be O
the O
need O
to O
add O
more O
RAM B-AS
. O

But O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
spend O
another O
thousand O
on O
a O
laptop O
since O
my O
work O
already O
provides O
me O
with O
a O
PC O
. O

Fine O
if O
you O
have O
a O
touch B-AS
screen I-AS
. O

can O
never O
go O
wrong O
with O
apple O
products O
. O

As O
far O
as O
user O
type O
- O
I O
dabble O
in O
everything O
from O
games B-AS
( O
WoW O
) O
to O
Photoshop B-AS
, O
but O
nothing O
professionally O
. O

It O
doesnt O
get O
hot O
like O
my O
PC O
, O
with O
technology O
always O
at O
the O
tip O
of O
our O
fingertips O
anytime O
I O
forget O
how O
to O
do O
something O
i O
just O
google O
it O
. O

I O
re O

seated O
the O

inside O
and O
re O

installed O

This O
by O
far O
beats O
any O
computer O
out O
on O
the O
market O
today O
built B-AS
well O
, O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
AMAZING O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
for O
anything O
high O
tech O
yet O
, O
but O
I O
love O
it O
already O
. O

The O
OS B-AS
is O
easy O
, O
and O
offers O
all O
kinds O
of O
surprises O
. O

I O
had O
to O
get O
Apple B-AS
Customer I-AS

to O
correct O
the O
problem O
. O

Ideal O
for O
someone O
on O
the O
go O
or O
for O
a O
high O
school O
students O
. O

A O
veryimportant O
feature O
is O
Firewire B-AS
800 I-AS
which O
in O
my O
experience O
works O
better O
then O
USB3 B-AS
( O
in O
PC O
enabled O
with O
USB3 B-AS
) O
I O
was O
not O
originally O
sold O
on O
the O
MAC B-AS
OS I-AS
I O
felt O
it O
was O
inferior O
in O
many O
ways O
To O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
. O

I O
like O
iTunes B-AS
, O
the O
apparent O

all O
the O
nice O

stuff I-AS
. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
used O
the O
card B-AS
reader I-AS
it O
took O
half O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
pair O
of O
tweezers O
to O
remove B-AS
the I-AS
card I-AS
. O

This O
flaw O
unfortunately O
detracts O
from O
everything O
else O
Apple O
got O
right O
with O
the O
Mini O
. O

After O
replacing O
the O
spinning B-AS
hard I-AS
disk I-AS
with O
an O
ssd B-AS
drive I-AS
, O
my O
mac O
is O
just O
flying O
. O

I O
know O
some O
people O
complained O
about O
HDMI B-AS
issues O
but O
they O
released O
a O
firmware B-AS
patch I-AS
to O
address O
that O
issue O
. O

With O
the O
needs O
of O
a O
professional O
photographer O
I O
generally O
need O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
best O
specs B-AS
. O

Added O
an O
iMac O
about O
2 O
years O
later O
. O

packing B-AS
and O
everything O
was O
perfect O

I O
will O
not O
hesitate O
to O
recommend O
it O
to O
family O
and O
friends O

I O
called O
Toshiba O
where O
I O
gave O
them O
the O
serial O
number O
and O
they O
informed O
me O
that O
they O
were O
having O
issues O
with O
the O
mother B-AS
boards I-AS
. O

I O
seem O
to O
be O
having O
repeat O
problems O
as O
the O
Mother B-AS
Board I-AS
in O
this O
one O
is O
diagnosed O
as O
faulty O
, O
related O
to O
the O
graphics B-AS
card I-AS
. O

It O
also O
comes O
with O
4G B-AS
of I-AS
RAM I-AS
but O
if O
you O
're O
like O
me O
you O
want O
to O
max O
that O
out O
so O
I O
immediately O
put O
8G B-AS
of I-AS
RAM I-AS
in O
her O
and O
I O
've O
never O
used O
a O
computer O
that O
performs B-AS
better O
. O

This O
computer O
is O
also O
awesome O
for O
my O
sons O
virtual B-AS
home I-AS
schooling I-AS
. O

Cost B-AS
is O
more O
as O
compared O
to O
other O
brands O

the O

the I-AS

This O
hardware B-AS
seems O
to O
be O
better O
than O
the O
iMac O
in O
that O
it O
is O
n't O
$ O
1400 O
and O
smaller O
. O

I O
'm O

I O
've O

about O
2 O
months O

found O

although O
some O
people O
might O
complain O
about O

I O
think O
is O
ridiculous O
