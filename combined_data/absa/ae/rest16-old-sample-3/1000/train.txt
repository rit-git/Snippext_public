As O
a O
fan O
of O
Thai O
, O
I O
have O
tried O
quite O
a O
few O
different O
restaurants O
in O
NYC O
and O
this O
one O
was O
definitely O
the O
worst O
. O

They O
are O
not O
helpful O
in O
the O
least O
and O
will O
give O
you O
the O
grand O
run O
around O
so O
by O
the O
time O
the O
event O
date O
rolls O
around O
you O
will O
not O
only O
regret O
chosing O
this O
place O
, O
but O
also O
become O
hostile O
! O

Had O
a O
late O
night O
dinner O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
. O

service B-AS
is O
friendly O
, O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
walking O
in O
and O
getting O
a O
table O
. O

The O
food B-AS
can O
get O
pricey O
but O
the O
prixe B-AS
fixe I-AS
tasting I-AS
menu I-AS
is O
the O
greatest O
food O
for O
a O
good O
price O
and O
they O
cater O
the O
food O
to O
any O
food O
allergies O
or O
food O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
. O

The O
first O
time O
the O
sushi B-AS
was O
outstanding O
, O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland O
. O

Prices O
are O
in O
line O
. O

Reliable O
, O
Fresh O
Sushi B-AS

The O
service B-AS
was O
impeccable O
and O
unobtrusive O
- O
- O
the O
staff B-AS
knows O
what O
they O
are O
there O
to O
do O
- O
- O
to O
know O
their O
menu O
, O
present O
your O
meal O
, O
and O
attend O
to O
your O
needs O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
handful O
of O
times O
, O
for O
no O
reason O
besides O
sheer O
convenience O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
looked O
great O
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
very O
nice O
, O
but O
when O
the O
food B-AS
came O
, O
it O
was O
average O
. O

Went O
for O
Mom O
's O
birthday O
brunch/ O
lunch O
. O

Was O
there O
Friday O
night O
. O

Too O
bad O
Latin O
Quarters O
closed O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
excellent O
as O
well O
as O
service B-AS
, O
however O
, O
I O
left O
The B-AS
Four I-AS
Seasons I-AS
very O
dissappointed O
. O

The O
design O
of O
the O
space B-AS
is O
good O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
outstanding O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
quick O
, O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional O
. O

Slightly O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
but O
worth O
it O
! O

Chow B-AS
fun I-AS
was O
dry O
; O
pork B-AS
shu I-AS
mai I-AS
was O
more O
than O
usually O
greasy O
and O
had O
to O
share O
a O
table O
with O
loud O
and O
rude O
family O
. O

It O
is O
also O
extremely O
well O
priced O
. O

Run O
do O
n't O
walk O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
ok O
, O
some O
of O
the O
people O
did O
n't O
get O
what O
they O
asked O
for O
. O

To O
top O
it O
all O
off.. O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

It O
is O
definitely O
a O
good O
spot B-AS
for O
snacks O
and O
chat O
. O

Raga B-AS
's I-AS
is O
a O
romantic O
, O
cozy O
restaurant O
. O

Good O
drink B-AS
. O

I O
don O
’ O
t O
usually O
visit O
the O
same O
establishment O
more O
than O
once O
, O
what O
more O
twice O
, O
but O
I O
’ O
ll O
come O
to O
Zenkichi B-AS
anytime O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
unhurried O
and O
memorable O
dinner O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
, O
but O
please O
put O
the O
bag O
down O
before O
delivering O
food O
! O

Mermaid B-AS
Inn I-AS
is O
an O
overall O
good O
restaurant O
with O
really O
good O
seafood B-AS
. O

Kind O
, O
attentive O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
. O

The O
rice B-AS
was O
poor O
quality O
and O
was O
cooked O
so O
badly O
it O
was O
hard O
. O

We O
got O
a O
little O
tipsy O
from O
the O
sake O
but O
is O
n't O
that O
what O
Saturday O
nights O
with O
the O
girlfriends O
are O
all O
about O
? O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
. O

we O
were O
tired O
and O
cold O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant O
, O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers O
. O

It O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table O
, O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner O
, O
DO O
NOT O
pass O
it O
up O
. O

IT O
WAS O
HORRIBLE O
. O

Please O
be O
aware O
that O
it O
's O
CASH O
or O
AMEX O
only O
! O

Compared O
to O
other O
shabu O
restaurants O
around O
town O
, O
this O
places O
wins O
hands- O
down O
. O

We O
order O
a O
bit O
of O
everything O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

Chicken B-AS
teriyaki I-AS
had O
tomato O
or O
pimentos O
on O
top O
? O
? O

Expensive O

At O
$ O
120 O
for O
two O
people O
, O
however O
, O
this O
in O
no O
way O
represents O
value O
, O
unless O
you O
're O
looking O
to O
pay O
by O
the O
hour O
for O
passive- O
aggressive O
torture O
. O

All O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
absolutely O
professional O
! O
! O

With O
so O
many O
good O
restaurants O
on O
the O
UWS O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
overpriced O
food B-AS
, O
absurdly O
arrogant O
wait B-AS
- I-AS
staff I-AS
who O
do O
n't O
recognize O
they O
work O
at O
a O
glorified O
diner O
, O
clumsy O
service B-AS
, O
and O
management B-AS
that O
does O
n't O
care O
. O

Ca O
n't O
wait O
wait O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
very O
simple O
but O
comfortable O
. O

( O
2 O
) O
egg O
custards O
and O
pork O
buns O
at O
either O
bakery O
on O
west O
side O
of O
Mott O
street O
just O
south O
of O
Canal O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
quick O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
use O
fancy O
ingredients B-AS
, O
but O
even O
fancy O
ingredients O
do O
n't O
make O
for O
good O
pizza B-AS
unless O
someone O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
the O
crust B-AS
right O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
amazing O
- O
I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
eat O
it O
quite O
regularly O
, O
but O
I O
can O
say O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
've O
had O
. O

The O
food O
arrived O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O
. O

supercilious O
scorn O
is O
in O
. O

I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
were O
eating O
in O
Paris O
. O

Food B-AS
took O
some O
time O
to O
prepare O
, O
all O
worth O
waiting O
for O
. O

The O
meat B-AS
is O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces B-AS
are O
great O
, O
you O
get O
kimchi B-AS
and O
a O
salad B-AS
free O
with O
your O
meal B-AS
and O
service B-AS
is O
good O
too O
. O

Noodle O
pudding O
is O
exactly O
the O
type O
of O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
I O
enjoy O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
. O

I O
was O
visiting O
New O
York O
City O
with O
a O
friend O
and O
we O
discovered O
this O
really O
warm O
and O
inviting O
restaurant B-AS
. O

Food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
as O
well O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
( O
though O
I O
wish O
the O
pork B-AS
belly I-AS
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O
bit O
longer O
, O
so O
that O
fat O
was O
more O
of O
a O
melt O
- O
in O
- O
your O
- O
mouth O
experience O
) O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O
food O
is O
cheaper O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

we O
have O
been O
there O
3 O
times O
since O
last O
week O
we O
alked O
it O
by O
chance O
first O
day O
the O
manager O
offerd O
us O
the O
margherita O
pizza O
adn O
we O
said O
yes O
. O

Sit O
outside O
in O
the O
warm O
weather O
; O
inside O
for O
cozy O
winter O
. O

A O
pleasant O
surprise O
. O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish O
Ive O
requested O
. O

Have O
frequented O
'ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food B-AS
remains O
excellent O
. O

Prices O
are O
very O
good O
. O

We O
visited O
Orsay O
during O
NY O
Restaurant O
Week O
and O
tried O
their O
$ O
35 O
menu O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

i O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
policy O
that O
goes O
along O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
self O
- O
respect O
, O
which O
includes O
not O
letting O
a O
waiter B-AS
intimidate O
me O
, O
i.e O
. O
make O
me O
feel O
bad O
asking O
for O
trivialities O
like O
water O
, O
or O
the O
check O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Saul O
, O
many O
times O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
always O
consistently O
, O
outrageously O
good O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
just O
ok O
, O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you O
'd O
expect O
for O
$ O
500 O
. O

I O
heartily O
recommend O
. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
and O
I O
've O
been O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O
. O

I O
'm O
saving O
up O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

First O
of O
all O
Dal B-AS
Bukhara I-AS
Rocks O
. O

The O
bread B-AS
was O
stale O
, O
the O
salad B-AS
was O
overpriced O
and O
empty O
. O

The O
large O
selection O
of O
bruschettas B-AS
, O
paninis B-AS
, O
tramezzinis B-AS
keep O
the O
palate O
from O
stagnating O
. O

Go O
to O
Volare O
for O
1st O
class O
service B-AS
and O
terrific O
food B-AS
. O

first O
it O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
find O
the O
place B-AS
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Casimir B-AS
over O
5 O
times O
and O
I O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
there O
. O

Wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
extensive O
without O
being O
over O
- O
priced O
. O

Shame O
on O
this O
place O
for O
the O
horrible O
rude O
staff B-AS
and O
non O
- O
existent O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
. O

It O
's O
simply O
the O
best O
meal B-AS
in O
NYC O
. O

I O
had O
my O
eyes O
on O
this O
place O
, O
promising O
myself O
I O
will O
one O
day O
'give O
it O
a O
try O
. O
' O

For O
me O
dishes B-AS
a O
little O
oily O
, O
but O
overall O
dining O
experience O
good O
. O

I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
with O
this O
restaurant B-AS
. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
back O
again O
and O
again O
. O

Remind O
me O
of O
home O
. O

Restaurant O
with O
a O
view B-AS

It O
was O
wonderful O
. O

Both O
times O
I O
was O
extremely O
dissappointed O
by O
the O
service B-AS
, O
which O
was O
boarderline O
rude O
. O

When O
asked O
about O
how O
a O
certain O
dish O
was O
prepared O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
similar O
at O
other O
thai O
restaurants O
, O
he O
replied O
this O
is O
not O
Mcdonald O
's O
, O
every O
place O
makes O
things O
differently O

I O
never O
used O
to O
be O
a O
fan O
of O
sakes O
but O
am O
lately O
experimenting O
with O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
and O
am O
acquiring O
a O
better O
taste O
of O
it O
. O

I O
loved O
this O
place B-AS
! O
! O

Great O
food B-AS
and O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
. O

Great O

, O
great O

. O

The O
food B-AS
's O
as O
good O
as O
ever O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
very O
average O
... O
the O
Thai B-AS
fusion I-AS
stuff I-AS
is O
a O
bit O
too O
sweet O
, O
every O
thing O
they O
serve O
is O
too O
sweet O
here O
. O

I O
had O
a O
grat O
time O
at O
Jekyll B-AS
and I-AS
Hyde I-AS
! O

Moderate O
prices O
. O

great O
food B-AS
, O
great O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
, O
great O
service B-AS
in O
a O
great O
neighborhood B-AS
... O

When O
you O
add O
it O
all O
together O
, O
it O
just O
does O
n't O
seem O
worth O
it O
to O
me O
... O
especially O
considering O
the O
prices O
. O

it O
is O
not O
consistent O
. O

Next O
time O
, O
we O
would O
n't O
dare O
ordering O
anything O
else O
other O
than O
some O
simple O
Asian O
appetizers O
and O
drinks O
. O

Too O
bad O
I O
had O
paid O
an O
extra O
$ O
2 O
for O
the O
stone B-AS
bowl I-AS
. O

I O
took O
one O
bite O
from O
the O
$ O
24 O
salmon B-AS
, O
and O
I O
have O
never O
, O
in O
the O
17 O
years O
I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
restaurants O
tasted O
salmon O
as O
fishy O
, O
as O
dry O
, O
and O
as O
bland O
as O
the O
one O
in O
Flatbush O
Farms O
. O

When O
I O
got O
there O
the O
place O
was O
packed O
but O
they O
made O
sure O
to O
seat O
me O
quickly O
. O

There O
were O
no O
communications O
issues O
either O
, O
as O
she O
spoke O
perfect O
English O
. O

The O
pasta B-AS
penne I-AS
was O
pretty O
extra O
buttery O
, O
creamy O
which O
means O
a O
big O
task O
to O
diggest.. O
tasty O
at O
first O
but O
i O
would O
say O
that O
i O
was O
full O
with O
a O
slice O
of O
pizza O
and O
7 O
to O
count O
, O
penne O
... O
got O
a O
little O
moody O
afterwards O
cause O
was O
stuffed O
... O
lol O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
ate O
here O
earlier O
this O
week O
and O
have O
not O
stopped O
ranting O
and O
raving O
about O
the O
food B-AS
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
not O
inviting O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
totally O
weird O
. O

Our O
family O
never O
expected O
such O
incredible O
entertainment O
in O
a O
restaurant B-AS
. O

A O
coworker O
and O
I O
tried O
Pacifico B-AS
after O
work O
a O
few O
Fridays O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

The O
view B-AS
is O
spectacular O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
great O
. O

Definitely O
a O
great O
spot B-AS
for O
a O
nice O
occasion O
or O
date O
. O

It O
is O
set O
far O
from O
the O
small O
street O
it O
's O
on O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
traffic O
noise O
. O

JUST O
AWSOME O
. O

Fine O
, O
I O
wont O
hang O
you O
for O
that O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
jelly B-AS
fish I-AS
, O
drunken B-AS
chicken I-AS
and O
the O
soupy B-AS
dumplings I-AS
, O
certainly O
the O
stir B-AS
fry I-AS
blue I-AS
crab I-AS
. O

its O
just O
a O
fun O
place O
to O
go O
, O
not O
a O
five O
star O
restaraunt B-AS
. O

We O
left O
, O
never O
to O
return O
. O

The O
kitchen B-AS
however O
, O
is O
almost O
always O
slow O
. O

Best O
Indian B-AS
Restaurant I-AS
in O
the O
City O

Hey O
, O
I O
think O
$ O
2+ O
for O
a O
5 O
block O

A O
real O
dissapointment O
. O

One O
of O
the O
BEST O

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
spot O
, O
very O
relaxing O
the O
food B-AS
is O
great O
all O
the O
times O
, O
celebrated O
my O
engagement O
and O
my O
wedding O
here O
, O
it O
was O
very O
well O
organized O

We O

My O

Once O

for O
brunch O

Loved O
It O

On O
our O
last O
visit O
, O
they O
skipped O
over O
our O
name O
on O
the O
list O
, O
leaving O
us O
waiting O
an O
extra O
hour O
for O
a O
table O
. O

To O
be O
honest O
we O
only O
ever O
eat O
the O
Shabu O
Shabu O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
a O
great O
bargain O
. O

Slightly O
above O
average O
wines B-AS
start O
at O
$ O
70+ O
with O
only O
one O
selection O
listed O
at O
$ O
30+ O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
reliable O
and O
the O
price O
is O
moderate O
. O

We O
have O
lived O
in O
Chelsea O
for O
two O
years O
and O
have O
never O
noticed O
this O
restaurant O
. O

As O
we O
were O
leaving O
, O
the O
couple O
standing O
by O
the O
door O
said O
to O
another O
waiter O
, O
we O
're O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O

After O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table O
and O
had O
dinner O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
so O
cheap O
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
nice O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
variety O
even O
for O
people O
who O
eat O
vegetarian O
like O
me O
. O

Seating B-AS
is O
always O
prompt O
, O
though O
the O
restaurant O
does O
fill O
up O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

This O
was O
a O
repeat O
visit O
and O
we O
'll O
definitely O
be O
back O
again O
. O

We O
are O
very O
particular O
about O
sushi B-AS
and O
were O
both O
please O
with O
every O
choice O
which O
included O
: O
ceviche B-AS
mix I-AS
( I-AS
special I-AS
) I-AS
, O
crab B-AS
dumplings I-AS
, O
assorted B-AS
sashimi I-AS
, O
sushi B-AS
and O
rolls B-AS
, O
two O
types O
of O
sake B-AS
, O
and O
the O
banana B-AS
tempura I-AS
. O

Among O
all O
of O
the O
new O
5th O
avenue O
restaurants O
, O
this O
offers O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
best O
values O
for O
your O
money O
. O

I O
LOOOVE O
their O
eggplant B-AS
pizza I-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
their O

Beautiful O

Lexicographers O
take O
note O
: O
a O
new O
and O
fascinating O
definition O
of O
rudeness O
is O
alive O
and O
flourishing O
right O
here O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price O
category O
. O

Not O
a O
very O
fancy O
place B-AS
but O
very O
good O
Chinese B-AS
style I-AS
Indian I-AS
food I-AS
. O

The O
owner B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
are O
all O
Japanese O
as O
well O
and O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
entire O
ambiance B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
average O
to O
above O
- O
average O
; O
the O
French B-AS
Onion I-AS
soup I-AS
filling O
yet O
not O
overly O
impressive O
, O
and O
the O
desserts B-AS
not O
brilliant O
in O
any O
way O
. O

I O
go O
twice O
a O
month O
! O

Eating O
in O
, O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
saves O
it O
, O
but O
at O
your O
desk O
, O
it O
's O
a O
very O
disappointing O
experience O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
finally O
said O
he O
would O
comp O
the O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
( O
which O
cost O
less O
than O
the O
food O
) O
, O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
concession O
. O

The O
jukebox B-AS
plays O
everything O
from O
Italian O
Opera O
to O
The O
Strokes O
. O

When O
I O
'm O
feeling O
stressed O
by O
the O
noise O
and O
congestion O
around O
my O
office O
, O
I O
head O
for O
Cafe O
St. O
Bart O
's O
. O

The O
stuff B-AS
tilapia I-AS
was O
horrid O
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard O
. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant O
and O
well O
runned O
business O
operation O
. O

I O
recently O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant B-AS
with O
some O
co O
- O
workers O
for O
lunch O
and O
had O
an O
amazing O
time O
. O

The O
setting B-AS
is O
casual O
and O
romantic O
. O

Everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
great O
. O

Its O
location B-AS
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-AS
again O
and O
again O
. O

Every O
time O
in O
New O
York O
I O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
visit O
Restaurant B-AS
Saul I-AS
on O
Smith O
Street O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
so O
much O
fun O
. O

And O
it O
all O
comes O
at O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O
( O
congee B-AS
, O
noodles B-AS
, O
and O
rice B-AS
dishes I-AS
are O
no O
more O
than O
$ O
3 O

I O
/ O
we O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place B-AS
again O

the O
waitstaffs B-AS
are O
nice O
though O

the O

was O
imazingly O
cooked O
well O
and O

which O
was O
tremendously O
gigantic O
portion O
... O
a O
bucket O

literally O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
the O
correct O
ambience B-AS
and O
an O
excellent O
staff B-AS
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O
and O
a O
friend O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
prompt O
, O
friendly O
and O
great O
. O

My O
girlfriend O
, O
being O
slightly O
more O
aggressive O
, O
and O
having O
been O
equally O
disgusted O
causing O
her O
to O
throw O
out O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
barely O
eaten O
meal B-AS
, O
called O
back O
only O
to O
be O
informed O
that O
I O
was O
probably O
wrong O
and O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
oyster O
, O
and O
that O
we O
were O
also O
blacklisted O
from O
their O
restaurant O

A O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
really O
hits O
the O
spot O
on O
a O
Sunday O
morning O
! O

Atmosphere B-AS
is O
nice O
and O
relaxed O
too O
... O

Indoor B-AS
was O
very O
cozy O
and O
cute O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
booths B-AS
allow O
you O
to O
sit O
next O
to O
eachother O
without O
looking O
like O
'that O
' O
couple O
. O

Really O
, O
I O
find O
it O
rather O
scandalous O
that O
such O
a O
crappy O
restaurant O
attracts O
such O
crowds- O
- O
this O

in O
the O

of O
a O
million O

at O

9/ O

Never O
have O
I O
had O
such O
dramatic O
delivery B-AS
guys I-AS
( O
a O
lot O
of O
huffing O
and O
panting O
and O
muttering O
under O
breath O

/ O
c O
I O
live O
in O
a O
walkup O
) O
who O
always O
seem O
disappointed O
with O
their O
tips O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
barely O
touched O
that O
mess O
of O
a O
dish B-AS
. O

The O
tables B-AS
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close O
, O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
typical O
of O
any O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
simply O
overpriced O
. O

I O
got O
an O
excellent O
piece O
of O
cheesecake B-AS
and O
we O
had O
several O
other O
nice O
pastries B-AS
. O

I O
think O
the O
stuff O
was O
better O
than O
Disney O
. O

Please O
take O
my O
advice O
, O
go O
and O
try O
this O
place B-AS
. O

The O
pesto B-AS
pizza I-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
thin O
- O
crust O
pizza O
with O
a O
nice O
amount O
of O
spicy B-AS
Italian I-AS
cheese I-AS
that O
I O
'd O
never O
heard O
of O
before O
. O

The O
bagels B-AS
always O
warm O
, O
soft O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
crispy O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
enormous O
in O
size O
. O

If O
you O
like O
spicy O
food O
get O
the O
chicken B-AS
vindaloo I-AS
. O

I O
really O
loved O
the O
different O
and O
inovated O
touch O
that O
's O
the O
cheff B-AS
gives O
to O
the O
food O
. O

The O
place O
's O
decor B-AS
and O
hidden B-AS
bathrooms I-AS
made O
for O
a O
good O
laugh O
. O

Never O
fails O
to O
please O
. O

For O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
1/ O
2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
. O

Skip O
Nathan O
's O
... O
you O
can O
get O
that O
at O
the O
mall O
... O
go O
to O
Bark O
. O

The O
service B-AS
varys O
from O
day O
to O
day O
- O
sometimes O
they O
're O
very O
nice O
, O
and O
sometimes O
not O
. O

The O
only O
fallback O
on O
this O
restaurant B-AS
is O
the O
prices O
. O

I O
've O
waited O
over O
one O
hour O
for O
food O
. O

They O
have O
it O
all O
- O
- O
great O
price O
, O
food B-AS
, O
and O
service B-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
the O
waiters B-AS
do O
n't O
do O
for O
you O
is O
wipe O
your O
chin O
when O
you O
leave O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
Roxy O
's O
for O
that O
, O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food B-AS
. O

This O
place O
has O
great O
indian B-AS
chinese I-AS
food I-AS
. O

The O
manager B-AS
came O
to O
the O
table O
and O
said O
we O
can O
do O
what O
we O
want O
, O
so O
we O
paid O
for O
what O
we O
did O
enjoy O
, O
the O
drinks B-AS
and O
appetizers B-AS
, O
and O
walked O
out O
. O

But O
that O
is O
highly O
forgivable O
. O

it O
helps O
if O
you O
know O
what O
to O
order O
. O

Delivery B-AS
guy I-AS
sometimes O
get O
upset O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
tip O
more O
than O
10 O
% O
. O

The O
location B-AS
is O
perfect O
. O

Over O
the O
years O
the O
host O
, O
Vittorio B-AS
, O
and O
his O
crew B-AS
, O
have O
always O
treated O
me O
as O
family O
- O
- O
although O
with O
all O
the O
business O
this O
not O
- O
so O
- O
little O
gem O
does O
, O
it O
amazing O
he O
's O
even O
able O
to O

did O
not O
stop O
to O

or O
clean O
the O
mess O
that O
was O
left O
on O

The O
food B-AS

The O
food B-AS
is O
decent O
at O
best O
, O
and O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
well O
, O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
, O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
wonderful O
; O

Ive O
asked O
a O
cart B-AS
attendant I-AS
for O
a O
lotus O
leaf O
wrapped O
rice O
and O
she O
replied O
back O
rice O
and O
just O
walked O
away O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
. O

Went O
to O
Cafe O
Spice O
with O
4 O
of O
my O
friends O
on O
a O
saturday O
night O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
large O
and O
the O
servers B-AS
always O
surprise O
us O
with O
a O
different O
starter O
. O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
HIGHLY O
RECOMMEND O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
good O
and O
the O
view B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
new I-AS

city I-AS
skiline I-AS
was O
terrific O
even O
on O
a O
foggy O
rainy O
day O
like O
that O
of O
when O
I O
went O
. O

Go O
here O
. O

Wonderful O
at O
holiday O
time O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
not O
what O
you O
are O
coming O
here O
for O
... O

The O
hostess O
said O
`` O
Wow O
that O
's O
a O
large O
group O
, O
unless O
you O
are O
n't O
together O
'' O
, O
to O
which O
I O
replied O
`` O
no O
we O
are O
, O
and O
there O
will O
be O
one O
more O
, O
so O
a O
table O
for O
six O
please O
. O
'' O

My O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers B-AS
and O
they O
were O
huge O
! O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
, O
I O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
I O
was O
speechless O
and O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
, O
and O
guess O
what O
, O
the O
waitress O
WALKED O
away O
. O

He O
offers O
subpar O
service B-AS
and O
has O
no O
personality O
. O

You O
will O
find O
yourself O
returning O
quite O
often O
. O

A O
little O
overpriced O
but O
worth O
it O
once O
you O
take O
a O
bite O
. O

Even O
though O
its O
good O
seafood B-AS
, O
the O
prices O
are O
too O
high O
. O

Always O
good O
drinks B-AS
and O
service B-AS
is O
pretty O
good O
; O

When O
we O
threatened O
to O
leave O
, O
we O
were O
offered O
a O
meager O
discount O
even O
though O
half O
the O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

Other O
guests O
enjoyed O
pizza B-AS
, O
santa B-AS
fe I-AS
chopped I-AS
salad I-AS
and O
fish B-AS
and I-AS
chips I-AS
. O

The O
service O
was O
poor O
, O
restaurant O
poorly O
lit O
, O
staff O
not O
very O
attentive O
and O
I O
would O
have O
rather O
eaten O
at O
a O
Mcdonald O
's O
than O
this O
joint O
. O

Drawbacks O
: O
service B-AS
is O
slow O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
toast O
! O

Easily O
the O
worst O
stir B-AS
- I-AS
fried I-AS
squid I-AS
I O
've O
ever O
tasted O

One O
of O
us O
actually O
liked O
the O
expresso B-AS
- O
that O
's O
it O
. O

a O
problem O
with O

save O
a O
missing O

once O
. O

The O

much O
better O
than O
the O
one O
on O
the O
west O
side O

A O
fairly O
late O
entry O
into O
the O
haute O
barnyard O
sweepstakes O
, O
Flatbush O
Farm O
is O
n't O
in O
the O
same O
league O
as O
the O
Blue O
Hills O
or O
even O
the O
Farm O
on O
Adderlys O
of O
the O
world O
, O
but O
it O
's O
pretty O
good O
, O
albeit O
with O
a O
somewhat O
dismal O
setting O
. O

and O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
prices O
. O

I O
went O
there O
with O
my O
friend O
last O
saturday O
. O

$ O
500 O
included O
: O

We O
started O
off O
with O
a O
delightful O
sashimi B-AS
amuse I-AS
bouche I-AS
. O

I O
asked O
for O
an O
open O
faced O
cheese O
sandwich O
and O
the O
manager B-AS
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O
my O
business O
elsewhere O
! O

I O
'm O
partial O
to O
the O
Gnocchi B-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
moved O
our O
table O
practically O
into O
the O
bathroom O
and O
when O
we O
asked O
to O
cancel O
our O
dinner O
orders O
because O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
eat O
sitting O
on O
the O
toilet O
, O
we O
were O
told O
no O
... O

Bukhara B-AS
Grill I-AS
, O
the O
tagline O
says O
it O
all.. O
`` O
INDIAN O
SPICE O
RAVE O
'' O

The O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
were O
fine O
, O
however O
the O
maitre B-AS
- I-AS
D I-AS
was O
incredibly O
unwelcoming O
and O
arrogant O
. O

It O
was O
pretty O
inexpensive O
too O
. O

They O
are O
extremely O
rude O
, O
not O
even O
apologizing O
for O
the O
horrible O
service B-AS
we O
got O
and O
handing O
us O
a O
bill O
well O
over O
$ O
500 O
for O
some O
drinks B-AS
adn O
their O
pita B-AS
bread I-AS
! O

I O
mentioned O
the O
squid O
dish O
was O
n't O
very O
good O
when O
the O
waitress O
visited O
. O

There O
are O
many O
Thai O
places O
in O
the O
city O
but O
so O
far O
Toons O
is O
# O
1 O
. O

I O
've O
been O
to O
at O
Cafe B-AS
Spice I-AS
probably O
5 O
- O
8 O
times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian O
restaurant O
around O
Union O
Square O
. O

I O
thought O
this O
place B-AS
was O
totally O
overrated O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
Chinese O
style O
BBQ B-AS
ribs I-AS
in O
the O
city O
. O

Moules B-AS
were O
excellent O
, O
lobster B-AS
ravioli I-AS
was O
VERY O
salty O
! O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
a O
friendlier O
staff B-AS
working O
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
exceptional O
. O

A O
little O
noise O
but O
I O
think O
that O
was O
because O
of O
our O
party O
! O

I O
have O
lived O
in O
Japan O
for O
7 O
years O
and O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
feel B-AS
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
like O
being O
back O
in O
Japan O
. O

If O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
, O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss O
this O
restaurant B-AS
. O

Cute O
and O
decorative O
. O

After O
dinner O
the O
manager B-AS
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
Where O
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
America O
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O
. O

The O
dinner B-AS
was O
ok O
, O
nothing O
I O
would O
have O
again O
. O

Always O
busy O
but O
fast O
moving O
. O

I O
'll O
keep O
this O
short O
. O

( O
that O
is O
A O
MUST O
, O
but O
not O
every O
restaurant O
can O
do O
... O
) O

His O
response O
was O
smug O
, O
arrogant O
, O
and O
condescending O
, O
totally O
consistent O
with O
his O
deportment O
on O
display O
all O
evening O
. O

We O
ate O
at O
this O
Thai O
place O
following O
the O
reviews O
but O
very O
unhappy O
with O
the O
foods B-AS
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
really O
trendi O
but O
they O
have O
forgotten O
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant O
, O
the O
food B-AS
. O

The O
entertainment O
was O
great O
they O
have O
shows O
that O
go O
on O
through O
out O
the O
dinner O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
inexpensive O
. O

Delicious O
crab B-AS
cakes I-AS
too O
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
Japanese B-AS
cuisine I-AS
. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
same O
waitress B-AS
looked O
at O
my O
like O
I O
was O
insane O
. O

Delivery B-AS
can O
be O
spot O
on O
or O
lacking O
depending O
on O
the O
weather O
and O
the O
day O
of O
the O
week O
. O

The O
bar B-AS
drinks I-AS
were O
Eh O
, O
ok O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
incredibly O
tiny O
. O

I O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken B-AS
and O
I O
was O
appalled O
. O

So O
what O
you O
really O
end O
up O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
restaurant B-AS
not O
the O
food B-AS
. O

You O
'll O
be O
ther O
for O
every O
anniversary O
, O
birthday O
, O
valentines O
day O
... O

It O
's O
a O
small O
cute O
restaurant B-AS
. O

Go O
hungry O
and O
enjoy O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
was O
so O
fun O
, O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
great O
, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
really O
tasty O
. O

Best O
Italian B-AS
food I-AS
I O
ever O
had O
( O
and O
being O
Italian O
, O
that O
means O
alot O
) O
. O

The O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order O
. O

It O
was O
wonderful O
. O

The O
sake B-AS
menu I-AS
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O
! O

I O
will O
definetly O
be O
going O
back O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
are O
avid O
restaurant O
goers O
, O
and O
we O
are O
always O
on O
the O
lookout O
for O
new O
places O
and O
our O
friend O
had O
recommended O
Flatbush O
Farms O
. O

As O
BFC B-AS
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
you O
almost O
always O
have O
to O
wait O
by O
the O
bar O
- O
and O
be O
abused O
by O
the O
front B-AS
of I-AS
house I-AS
staff I-AS
until O
you O
are O
seated O
, O
which O
can O
be O
over O
an O
hour O
later O
! O

Whenever O
you O
need O
a O
Sushi O
fix O
, O
Mizu O
will O
be O
there O
with O
quality O
fish B-AS
and O
great O
service B-AS
. O

I O
was O
almost O
amused O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
turning O
away O
customers O
at O
9pm O
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
because O
she O
`` O
had O
a O
BBQ O
to O
go O
to O
'' O
that O
night O
- O
WTF O
? O
? O

Yamato B-AS
is O
an O
excellent O
place O
to O
go O
if O
youre O
not O
into O
sashimi O
, O
or O
if O
you O
have O
friends O
who O
doesnt O
like O
sushi O
much O
. O

A O
weakness O
is O
the O
chicken B-AS
in I-AS
the I-AS
salads I-AS
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
I O
had O
such O
gross O
food B-AS
in O
New O
York O
. O

I O
come O
here O
enjoy O
very O
much O
with O
husband O
. O

The O
spicy B-AS
tuna I-AS
roll I-AS
was O
unusually O
good O
and O
the O
rock B-AS
shrimp I-AS
tempura I-AS
was O
awesome O
, O
great O
appetizer O
to O
share O
! O

Ive O
been O
to O
many O
Thai O
restaurants O
in O
Manhattan O
before O
, O
and O
Toons O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
Thai O
food O
Ive O
had O
( O
except O
for O
my O
mom O
's O
of O
course O
) O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Rao B-AS
's I-AS
probably O
15 O
times O
the O
past O
3 O
years O
and O
it O
keeps O
getting O
better O
. O

Best O
restaurant B-AS
in O
Brooklyn O

Sometimes O
you O
pay O
a O
lot O
and O
do O
n't O
get O
much O
in O
return O
- O
it O
's O
manhattan O
, O
things O
are O
expensive O
. O

Have O
been O
dozens O
of O
times O
and O
never O
failed O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
. O

We O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside O
. O

I O
also O
recommend O
the O
rice B-AS
dishes I-AS
or O
the O
different O
varieties O
of O
congee B-AS
( I-AS
rice I-AS
porridge I-AS
) I-AS
. O

If O
you O
like O
your O
music B-AS
blasted O
and O
the O
system O
isnt O
that O
great O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
at O
least O
100 O
dollar O
bottle B-AS
minimun I-AS
then O
you O
'll O
love O
it O
here O
. O

The O
floor O
was O
wet O
, O
the O
trash O
can O
filled O
with O
hand O
towels O
n O
all O
over O
the O
floor O
, O
no O
soap O
, O
and O
no O
hand O
towels O
left O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
amazing O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
prompt O
and O
helpful O
, O
but O
not O
over O
- O
bearing O
or O
rushed O
. O

For O
authentic O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
look O
no O
further O
than O
Toons O
. O

Gorgeous O
place B-AS
ideal O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O

Best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm O
vibe B-AS
, O
the O
owner B-AS
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
service B-AS
is O
fast O
. O

Nice O
view B-AS
of I-AS
river I-AS
and I-AS
NYC I-AS
. O

Great O
place B-AS
to O
relax O
and O
enjoy O
your O
dinner O

The O
family B-AS
seafood I-AS
entree I-AS
was O
very O
good O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
awful O
. O

The O
veal B-AS
was O
incredible O
last O
night O
. O

We O
love O
the O
food B-AS
, O
drinks B-AS
, O
and O
atmosphere B-AS
! O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager B-AS
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent O
. O

But O
for O
the O
Shabu B-AS
Shabu I-AS
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
find O
much O
better O
in O
NY O
. O

I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
consider O
myself O
to O
be O
quite O
an O
expert O
on O
it O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
night O
tho O
... O
but O
they O
REALLY O
need O
to O
clean O
that O
vent B-AS
in O
the O
ceiling O
... O
its O
quite O
un O
- O
appetizing O
, O
and O
kills O
your O
effort O
to O
make O
this O
place B-AS
look O
sleek O
and O
modern O
. O

The B-AS
Four I-AS
Seasons I-AS
has O
history O
and O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
landmark O
of O
New O
York O
City O
restaurants O
, O
but O
trust O
me O
, O
they O
will O
charge O
you O
through O
the O
nose O
just O
so O
that O
you O
can O
say O
`` O
I O
've O
been O
to O
the O
four O
seasons O
restaurant O
'' O
. O

Food B-AS
- O
awesome O
. O

Just O
moved O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
we O
've O
been O
trying O
all O
the O
West O
Village O
Sushi O
restaurants O
. O

Cute O
place B-AS
, O
nice O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
but O
would O
never O
go O
there O
again O
. O

Calling O
the O
place B-AS
Hampton O
Chutney O
Co. O
does O
warn O
you O
that O
these O
folks O
offer O
more O
style O
than O
substance O
, O
but O
in O
this O
unattractive O
room B-AS
with O
unhelpful O
clerks B-AS
there O
was O
a O
dearth O
of O
the O
former O
too O
. O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
although O
the O
service B-AS
is O
poor O
. O

the O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
were O
juicy O
and O
tender O
inside O
and O
had O
plenty O
of O
crunch O
and O
snap O
on O
the O
outside O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
okay O
, O
nothing O
great O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
vibrant O
and O
eye O
- O
pleasing O
with O
several O
semi B-AS
- I-AS
private I-AS
boths I-AS
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
dining O
hall O
, O
which O
are O
great O
for O
a O
date O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
good O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
lie O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
truly O
caters O
to O
all O
your O
needs O
. O

It O
was O
totally O
overpriced O
- O
fish B-AS
and I-AS
chips I-AS
was O
about O
$ O
15 O
... O
. O

Very O
pleased O

If O
the O
weather O
is O
nice O
, O
try O
to O
snag O
an O
outside B-AS
table I-AS
. O

But O
too O
far O
east O
! O

The O
restaurant B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy O
a O
great O
meal B-AS

For O
those O
that O
go O
once O
and O
do O
n't O
enjoy O
it O
, O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
they O
just O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
I O
never O
write O
reviews O
- O
- O
I O
just O
was O
so O
moved O
by O
how O
bad O
this O
place B-AS
was O
, O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
my O
duty O
to O
spread O
the O
word O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
authentic O
. O

Very O
good O
wine B-AS
choices I-AS
. O

Good O
creative O
rolls B-AS
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
service B-AS
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O
. O

They O
're O
are O
better O
Taiwanese O
restaurants O
and O
they O
are O
located O
in O
Flushing O
, O
Queens O
. O

Best O
Indian B-AS
Chinese I-AS
in O
the O
city O
, O
by O
far O
! O

I O
've O
been O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place O
forever O
and O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
. O

The O
high O
prices O
you O
're O
going O
to O
pay O
is O
for O
the O
view B-AS
not O
for O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Service B-AS
was O
prompt O
and O
courteous O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
cheescake B-AS
like O
this O
. O

I O
recieved O
prompt O
service B-AS
with O
a O
smile O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
amazing O
... O
especially O
if O
you O
get O
the O
Chef B-AS
's I-AS
tasting I-AS

your O
favourite O

My O

also O
good O

- O
they O
did O

Went O
to O
this O
place O
this O
place O
on O
a O
real O
cold O
night O
and O
needed O
a O
quick O
meal O

The O

are O
very O
friendly O
. O

And O
how O
many O
times O
can O
you O
pick O
up O
the O
same O
perfectly O
aligned O
set O
of O
napkins O
, O
inspect O
them O
vapidly O
and O
plonk O
them O
down O
in O
exactly O
the O
same O
place O
instead O
of O
venturing O
a O
glance O
at O
people O
who O
are O
there O
to O
help O
you O
make O
the O
rent O
? O

I O
attended O
a O
holiday O
dinner O
at O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
group O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
were O
well O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
attentive O
. O

It O
was O
$ O
14 O
not O
really O
bad O
for O
a O
pound O
of O
Pastrami- O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
have O
much O
taste- O
I O
've O
had O
better O
for O
less O
elsewhere O
! O

Looking O
around O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
room O
full O
of O
New O
Yorkers O
enjoying O
a O
real O
meal B-AS
in O
a O
real O
restaurant B-AS
, O
not O
a O
clubhouse O
of O
the O
fabulous O
trying O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

I O
am O
not O
the O
most O
experienced O
person O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
Thai O
food O
, O
but O
my O
friend O
who O
took O
me O
there O
is O
. O

We O
thought O
the O
dessert B-AS
would O
be O
better O
, O
Wrong O
! O

This O
place B-AS
, O
which O
is O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O
, O
is O
perhaps O
Queens O
' O
biggest O
secret O
! O

Great O
food B-AS
, O
great O
decor B-AS
, O
great O
service B-AS
. O

We O
ordered O
our O
appetizers O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
chicken O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
the O
salmon O
. O

We O
know O
the O
difference O
between O
and O
oyster O
and O
bad O
fish O
. O

But O
the O
pizza B-AS
is O
way O
to O
expensive O
. O

please O
do O
n't O
fool O
us O
. O

Maggot O
in O
the O
food B-AS
! O

Fish B-AS
is O
so O
very O
fresh O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
sushi B-AS
in O

While O
their O

food I-AS
is O
delicious O
, O
their O
Sushi B-AS

out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

Place B-AS
is O
open O
till O
late O
, O
no O

This O
is O
the O
first O
place O
I O
've O
been O
that O
a O
runner B-AS
remembers O
my O
order O
... O
hope O
he O
likes O
his O
job O
because O
I O
have O
half O
a O
mind O
to O
steal O
him O
for O
my O
restaurant O
. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
restaurant B-AS
was O
nice O
and O
clean O
. O

Good O
food B-AS
: O
my O
favorite O
is O
the O
seafood B-AS

and O
delicious O
accompaniment O
to O
our O
afternoon O
of O

we O

You O
would O

, O
no O

Great O
Atmosphere B-AS

We O
'd O
go O
back O
again O

What O
we O
did O
do O
was O
waste O
3 O
hours O
being O
trapped O
in O
a O
table O
waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O
food O
and O
drinks O
and O
hooka.. O
some O
of O
which O
we O
never O
received O
! O

I O
have O
been O
doing O
all O
of O
the O
above O
at O
the O
Heartland B-AS
Brewery I-AS
for O
over O
5 O
years O
now O
and O
I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
BEEN O
DISAPPOINTED O
! O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
pretty O
nice O
but O
had O
a O
bit O
lacking O
, O
which O
it O
tries O
to O
make O
up O
for O
with O
a O
crazy O
scheme B-AS
of I-AS
mirrors I-AS
. O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could O
've O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion B-AS
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B-AS
fries I-AS
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

Appetizers O
took O
nearly O
an O
hour O
. O

Price O
no O
more O
than O
a O
Jersey O
deli O
but O
way O
better O
. O

Do O
n't O
miss O
Bloom B-AS
's I-AS
on O
your O
next O
trip O
to O
Manhatten O
. O

Also O
, O
specify O
if O
you O
like O
your O
food B-AS
spicy O
- O
its O
rather O
bland O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
. O

I O
went O
there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite O
size O
food O
and O
refleshment O
with O
my O
date O
. O

We O
ate O
outside O
at O
Haru O
's O
Sake O
bar O
because O
Haru O
's O
restaurant O
next O
door O
was O
overflowing O
. O

Big B-AS
Wong I-AS
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
eat O
and O
fill O
your O
stomach O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
tell O
you O
. O

In O
the O
end O
you O
end O
up O
with O
a O
fair O
tab O
and O
NOTHING O
BUT O
A O
GREAT O
TIME O
! O
! O
! O

Excellent O
food B-AS
for O
great O
prices O

My O
boyfriend O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
switch O
and O
eat O
his O
salmon O
instead O
, O
while O
he O
de- O
skinned O
the O
chicken O
so O
that O
I O
could O
enjoy O
the O
white O
meat O
. O

I O
came O
into O
the O
city O
to O
try O
out O
this O
restaurant O
because O
a O
friend O
had O
recommended O
it O
to O
my O
husband O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
even O
going O
to O
bother O
to O
describe O
it O
; O
it O
speaks O
for O
itself O
. O

This O
is O
the O
BEST O

- I-AS
Shabu I-AS
Restaurant I-AS
in O
the O
Try O
- O
State O
Area O
. O

Not O
cheap O
but O
very O
yummy O
. O

I O
ate O
here O
a O
week O
ago O
and O
found O
most O
dishes B-AS
average O
at O
best O
and O
too O
expensive O
. O

I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
that O
went O
for O
this O
horrible O
experience O
. O

Great O
survice B-AS

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
n't O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
that O
's O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices O
down O
. O

The O
omlette B-AS
for I-AS
brunch I-AS
is O
great O
... O

You O
can O
do O
it O
here O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
even O
enjoy O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
because O
it O
was O
hidden O
completely O
under O
the O
chicken O
and O
spinach O
. O

There O
are O

people O
waiting O

The O

, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous O

No O
plans O
to O
return O
anytime O
soon O
. O

We O
arrived O
and O
were O
seated O
immediately O
, O
which O
made O
us O
both O
happy O
. O

The O
dishes B-AS
offered O
were O
unique O
, O
very O
tasty O
and O
fresh O
from O
the O
lamb B-AS
sausages I-AS
, O
sardines B-AS
with I-AS
biscuits I-AS
, O
large B-AS
whole I-AS
shrimp I-AS
to O
the O
amazing O
pistachio B-AS
ice I-AS
cream I-AS
( O
the O
best O
and O
freshest O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
) O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

THIS O
STAFF B-AS
SHOULD O
BE O
FIRED O
. O

I O
would O
not O
expect O
this O
for O
a O
$ O
55 O
dinner B-AS
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

I O
was O
in O
love O
with O
Pongsri O
on O
48th O
, O
but O
compared O
to O
Suan O
it O
is O
slow O
in O
service O
and O
overpriced O

, O
food B-AS
is O
excellent O
. O

By O
far O
, O
the O
best O
pizza B-AS
in O
Manhattan O
. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
there O
since O
it O
opened O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O
enough O

I O
've O
been O
here O
twice O
now O

Molto O
bene O

First O
of O
all O
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
* O
not O
* O
romantic O
, O
as O
claimed O
by O
Citysearch O
's O
editorial O
review O
. O

At O
first O
we O
were O
a O
little O
taken O
aback O
, O
as O
this O
seemed O
to O
present O
a O
problem O
, O
although O
the O
restaurant O
looked O
fairly O
empty O
, O
but O
they O
hastily O
put O
the O
table O
together O
for O
us O
. O

This O
is O
a O
wonderful O
place B-AS
on O
all O
stand O
points O
especially O
value O
ofr O
money O
. O

Restaurants O
in O
manhattan O
should O
try O
to O
model O
food O
and O
service O
after O
this O
place O
. O

I O
've O
never O
ordered O
anything O
else O
from O
their O
menu O
... O
there O
's O
no O
need O
to O
. O

The O
potato B-AS
balls I-AS
were O
not O
dry O
at O
all O
... O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
buttery O
. O

However O
, O
I O
think O
Jeckll B-AS
and I-AS
Hydes I-AS
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
once O
. O

What O
more O
could O
you O
want O
? O

I O
love O
it O
. O

Guacamole+shrimp B-AS
appetizer I-AS
was O
really O
great O
, O
we O
both O
had O
the O
filet B-AS
, O
very O
good O
, O
did O
n't O
much O
like O
the O
frites B-AS
that O
came O
with O
, O
but O
the O
filet O
was O
so O
good O
, O
neither O
of O
us O
cared O
. O

Just O
straight O
up O
cheap O
, O
good O
food B-AS
. O

Chennai B-AS
Garden I-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
Indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
am O
pleasantly O
suprised O
and O
I O
will O
most O
likely O
stop O
in O
again O
if O
I O
am O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
very O
good O
. O

When O
I O
called O
this O
morning O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12 O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

NO O
PIZZA B-AS

for O
me O
! O

You O
can O
get O
a O
table O
without O
a O
reservation O
if O
you O
get O
there O
early O
I O
they O
do O
n't O
make O
you O
by O
bottles O
. O

Service B-AS
here O
was O
great O
, O
food B-AS
was O
fantastic O
. O

I O
have O
NEVER O
been O
disappointed O
in O
the O
Red B-AS
Eye I-AS
. O

fresh B-AS
restaurant I-AS
was O
amazing O
... O
... O
.. O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
and O
of O
course O
fresh O
. O

Best O
Pastrami B-AS
I O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion B-AS
without O
being O
ridiculous O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Lamb B-AS
special I-AS
which O
was O
perfect O
. O

but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
there O
were O
n't O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
dumplings O
in O
the O
appetizer O
section O
. O

Will O
not O
be O
back O
. O

Poor O
service B-AS
and O
management B-AS

Much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
accomodating O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
and O
the O
place B-AS
is O
lovely O
. O

Although O
the O
tables B-AS
may O
be O
closely O
situated O
, O
the O
candle B-AS
- I-AS
light I-AS
, O
food B-AS
- O
quality O
and O
service B-AS
overcompensate O
. O

We O
wo O
n't O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served O
. O

But O
the O
best O
part O
about O
LS O
is O
the O
late B-AS
night I-AS
atmosphere I-AS
, O
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O
BTs O
. O

So O
rushing O
us O
out O
was O
absolutely O
unnecessary O
! O

The O
only O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
here O
is O
walk O
in O
and O
eat O
.. O
but O
planning O
an O
event O
, O
especially O
a O
small O
, O
intimate O
one O
, O
forget O
about O
it O
. O

Ingredients B-AS
are O
organic O
which O
is O
a O
real O
plus O
for O
me O
. O

The O
sashimi B-AS
is O
always O
fresh O
and O
the O
rolls B-AS
are O
innovative O
and O
delicious O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

Even O
the O
pasta O
is O
delicious O
here O
( O
a O
rarity O
in O
New O
York O
pizza O
restaurants O
) O
. O

We O
replied O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
wait O
5 O
more O
minutes O
if O
that O
was O
okay O
. O

Got O
a O
date O
? O
Go O
here O
! O

Need O
I O
say O
more O
? O

The O
characters B-AS
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O
. O

short O
and O
sweet O
– O
seating B-AS
is O
great O
: O
it O
's O
romantic O
, O
cozy O
and O
private O
. O

Service B-AS
ok O
but O
unfriendly O
, O
filthy O
bathroom B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
has O
so O
many O
fish O
items O
and O
oysters O
. O

This O
tiny O
Williamsburg B-AS
spot I-AS
is O
always O
pleasantly O
surprising O
. O

I O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant B-AS
and O
will O
certainly O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
, O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
and O
the O
place B-AS
its O
self O
was O
great O
. O

Rao B-AS
is O
a O
good O
restaurant O
, O
but O
it O
's O
nothing O
special O
. O

However O
, O
most O
of O
them O
are O
at O
least O
prompt O
and O
pleasant O
. O

Having O
hunted O
around O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
romantic O
, O
yet O
not O
hideously O
expensive O
restaurant O
I O
stumbled O
across O
reviews O
for O
La O
Lanterna O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O
. O

It O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
packed O
on O
weekends O
, O
but O
the O
vibe B-AS
is O
good O
and O
it O
is O
the O
best O
French B-AS
food I-AS
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
area O
. O

And O
where O
does O
Patis B-AS
go O
wrong O
; O
no O
where O
. O

It O
’ O
s O
just O
you O
and O
your O
date O
and O
an O
occasional O
cute O
‘ O
excuse O
me O
’ O
before O
the O
waiter B-AS
opens O
the O
little O
curtain O
to O
your O
booth O
! O

Love O

Best O

! O

The O
place B-AS
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar B-AS
scene I-AS
seems O
to O
be O
happening O
. O

Considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O
least O
$ O
60 O
a O
head O
, O
I O
expect O
better O
service B-AS
. O

Maybe O
it O
has O
improved O
since O
then O
? O

They O
have O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
different O
cream B-AS
cheeses I-AS
and O
all O
of O
their O
salads B-AS
are O
great O
. O

It O
hits O
the O
spot O
every O
time O

If O
you O
are O
the O
type O
of O
person O
who O
likes O
being O
scared O
and O
entertained O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place B-AS
to O
go O
and O
eat O
. O

Without O
the O
wait O
or O
attitude O
, O
I O
would O
probably O
go O
back O
, O
but O
there O
are O
just O
too O
many O
other O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
that O
are O
as O
good O
or O
better O
and O
do O
n't O
make O
me O
jump O
through O
hoops O
. O

Love O
YUKA B-AS
. O

And O
evaluated O
on O
those O
terms O
Pastis B-AS
is O
simply O
wonderful O
. O

Visited O
there O
while O
on O
vacation O
and O
reading O
the O
reviews O
. O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
banana O
tempura O
for O
dessert B-AS
and O
they O
dont O
have O
. O

I O
wo O
n't O
go O
back O
unless O
someone O
else O
is O
footing O
the O
bill O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
a O
diamond O
in O
rough O
- O
- O
the O
food O
is O
delicious O
and O
homemade O
with O
the O
perfect O
balance B-AS
of I-AS
herbs I-AS
and I-AS
tomatoes I-AS
. O

This O
place O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
served O
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
. O

It O
's O
a O
nice O
place B-AS
to O
relax O
and O
have O
conversation O
. O

Definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
to O
Battery O
Park O
City O
! O

So O
, O
I O
switch O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
again O
to O
see O
if O
maybe O
I O
could O
stomach O
the O
meat O
and O
spinach O
again O
, O
but O
the O
spinach B-AS
was O
so O
undercooked O
that O
I O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it O
. O

I O
know O
because O
I O
live O
nearby O
. O

Seriously O
, O
this O
place B-AS
kicks O
ass O
. O

The O
fried B-AS
dumplings I-AS
are O
GREAT O
! O

I O
noticed O
alot O
of O
indian O
people O
eatting O
there O
which O
is O
a O
great O
sign O
for O
an O
indian B-AS
place I-AS
! O

Everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy O
with O
their O
food B-AS
, O
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
grilled B-AS
Mahi I-AS
Mahi I-AS
, O
seemingly O
drenched O
in O
Grapfruit O
Juice O
! O

Toons B-AS
has O
recently O
been O
redone O

so O
it O
's O
now O
a O
very O
attractive O
space O
. O

Indo B-AS

How O
this O

survives O
the O
competitive O
west O
village O
market O
in O
this O
economy O
, O
or O
any O
other O
for O
that O
matter O
, O

this O
little O
place B-AS

a O
cute O

I O
picked O
the O
Grilled B-AS
Black I-AS
Cod I-AS
as O
my O
entree O
, O
which O
I O
absolutely O
devoured O
while O
someone O
commented O
that O
the O
Grilled B-AS
Salmon I-AS
dish I-AS
was O
better O
. O

We O
had O
fun O
eating O
in O
there O
, O
we O
were O
there O
like O
around O
3 O
a.m. O
in O
the O
morning O
! O

The O
food B-AS
tasted O
very O
good O

This O

Our O
visit O

to O

the O

, O
was O
an O
unpleasant O
and O
costly O
experience O

I O
think O
I O
've O
had O
some O
the O
best O
meals B-AS
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
the O
only O
thing O
good O
about O
this O
restaurant B-AS
. O

The O
entrees O
were O
served O
with O
miso O

even O
all O
the O

ALL O
TOTALLY O
Japanese O

Too O
bad O
the O
food B-AS
was O
n't O
of O
the O
same O
heritage O
. O

The O

list I-AS
is O
extensive O
and O
can O
easily O
hike O
up O
an O

Everything O
about O
this O
restaurant B-AS
was O
special O
. O

Better O
than O
the O
bagel O
shop O
on O
the O
corner O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
going O
out O
of O
your O
way O
for O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

never O
swaying O
, O
never O
a O
bad O
meal B-AS
, O
never O
bad O
service B-AS
... O

Their O
sake B-AS
list I-AS
was O
extensive O
, O
but O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
Purple O
Haze O
, O
which O
was O
n't O
listed O
but O
made O
for O
us O
upon O
request O
! O

I O
tend O
to O
judge O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
by O
its O
sea B-AS
urchin I-AS
, O
which O
was O
heavenly O
at O
sushi O
rose O
. O

The O
restaurant B-AS
is O
cute O
but O
not O
upscale O
. O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
, O
however O
, O
upon O
reading O
the O
reviews O
I O
got O
take O
out O
last O

Best O

If O
you O

If O
you O

unfriendly O
staff B-AS
and O
a O

that O

then O
this O
is O

Great O
food B-AS
, O
good O
size O
menu B-AS
, O
great O
service B-AS
and O
an O
unpretensious O
setting B-AS
. O

We O
were O
greeted O
promptly O
by O
the O
waiter B-AS
who O
was O
very O
nice O
and O
cordial O
. O

The O
sauce B-AS
tasted O
more O
like O
Chinese O
fast O
food O
than O
decent O
Korean O
. O

It O
's O
a O
little O
out O
of O
our O
price O
range O
for O
dining O
there O
except O
on O
special O
occasions O

but O
we O
've O

6 O

go O

for O
the O
drinks B-AS

I O
've O
been O
many O
time O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
all O
shared O
so O
we O
get O
to O
order O
together O
and O
eat O
together O
. O

Decor B-AS
is O
nice O
though O
service B-AS
can O
be O
spotty O
. O

This O
restaurant O
is O
VEGETARIAN O
; O
there O
are O
NO O

You O
can O
not O
go O
wrong O
at O
the O

My O
six O

Save O
yourself O
the O
time O
and O
trouble O
and O
skip O
this O
one O

I O
'd O
highly O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
- O
- O
it O
provides O
and O
intimate O
setting B-AS
and O
nice O
service B-AS
. O

Surprised O
that O
a O
place O
of O
this O
caliber O
would O
advertise O
it O
as O
Kobe O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
. O

Not O
sure O
where O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
, O
lonk O
, O
dined O
, O
but O
Saul O
is O
in O
a O
great O
neighborhood B-AS
and O
has O
great O
food B-AS
! O

Which O
of O
course O
is O
not O
real O
Kobe O
but O
Wagyu O
beef O
. O

Right O
off O
the O
L O
in O
Brooklyn O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
cozy O
place B-AS
with O
good O
pizza B-AS
. O

Overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
our O
other O
sushi O
favorites O
, O
but O
everything O
was O
delicious O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place B-AS
! O

You O
'll O
pay O
at O
least O
double O
at O
any O
other O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
, O
and O
most O
still O
do O
n't O
compare O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
! O

They O
forgot O
a O
sandwich O
, O
did O
n't O
include O
plastic O
forks O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
include O
pita O
with O
the O
hummus O
platter O
. O

I O
paid O
just O
about O
$ O
60 O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-AS
, O
though O
: O
) O

Our O
friends O
have O
not O
arrived O
yet O

It O
's O
cuz O
it O
's O
so O
good O
you O
need O
to O
taste O
it O

! O

When O
the O
main O
course O
finally O
arrived O
( O
another O
45mins O
) O
half O
of O
our O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

My O
Girlfriend O
and O
I O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping O
place B-AS
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great O
time O
! O

Just O
want O
to O
warn O
you O
all O
- O
do O
n't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O

The O
prices O
are O
wonderfully O
low O
. O

Everything O
I O
had O
was O
good O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
a O
eater O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
here O
is O
long O
for O
dim O
sum O
, O
but O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
sharing O
tables O
or O
if O
the O
typical O
raucous O
dim O
sum O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
not O
your O
gig O
, O
this O
is O
a O
sleek O
( O
for O
Chinatown O
) O
alternative O
. O

The O
server B-AS
was O
really O
cool O
and O
served O
us O
our O
food O
and O
drinks O
with O
a O
smile O
. O

A O
quintessential O
slice B-AS
of I-AS
NYC I-AS
pizza I-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
nice O
and O
calm O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
jus O
too O
good O
to O
not O
praise O
it O
. O

The O
quantity O
is O
also O
very O
good O
, O
you O
will O
come O
out O
satisfied O
. O

Never O
got O
an O
explanation O
as O
to O
what O
was O
going O
on O
. O

The O
environment B-AS
is O
very O
upscale O
and O
you O
will O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
rich O
guys O
with O
trophy O
wives O
or O
just O
highly O
paid O
escorts O
. O

It O
's O
very O
spicy O
but O
not O
offensive O
. O

Would O
NEVER O
go O
back O

Great O
atmoshere B-AS
and O
worth O
every O
bit O
. O

Good O
spreads B-AS
, O
great O
beverage B-AS
selections I-AS
and O
bagels B-AS
really O
tasty O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
always O
packed O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
excellent O
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

Check O
out O
the O
secret O
back B-AS
room I-AS
. O

Service B-AS
is O
fast O
and O
friendly O
. O

This O
is O
where O
it O
really O
really O
gets O
bad O
: O
the O
manager B-AS
said O
, O
there O
is O
absolutely O
nothing O
we O
can O
do O
, O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
taste O
that O
she O
did O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
and O
I O
can O
not O
comp O
it O
. O

great O
toppings B-AS
definitely O
a O
place B-AS
you O
need O
to O
check O
out O
for O
late O
night O
munchies O
or O
a O
mid O
day O

Great O
Indian B-AS
Food I-AS
! O

I O
found O
the O
food B-AS
to O
be O
outstanding O
, O
particulary O
the O
salmon B-AS
dish I-AS
I O
had O
. O

The O
space B-AS
is O
limited O
so O
be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
up O
to O
45 O
minutes O
- O
1 O
hour O
, O
but O
be O
richly O
rewarded O
when O
you O
savor O
the O
delicious O
indo B-AS
- I-AS
chinese I-AS
food I-AS
. O

Service B-AS
was O
good O
and O
food B-AS
is O
wonderful O
. O

It O
's O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
places O
to O
eat O
in O
NY O
. O

However O
, O
go O
for O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
and O
consider O
the O
food B-AS
just O
a O
companion O
for O
a O
trip O
across O
the O
world O
! O

They O
were O
very O
abrupt O
with O
me O
when O
I O
called O
and O
actually O
claimed O
the O
food O
was O
late O
because O
they O
were O
out O
of O
rice O
. O

this O
place O
had O
ALL O
the O
trimmings B-AS
and O
i O
mean O
all O
. O

it O
's O
the O
only O
place O
you O
can O
get O
yummy O
authentic O
japanese B-AS
comfort I-AS
food I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
tasty O
and O
portion B-AS
sizes I-AS
are O
appropriate O
. O

The O
workers O
there O
also O
absolutely O
load O
the O
bagel B-AS
with O
cream O
cheese O
( O
gets O
a O
little O
messy O
) O
. O

We O
never O
ate O
because O
by O
close O
to O
2 O
in O
the O
monring O
we O
were O
not O
served O
and O
were O
too O
upset O
ad O
tired O
to O
start O
eating O
. O

Their O
tuna B-AS
tartar I-AS
appetizer I-AS
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

Also O
, O
they O
do O
not O
take O
credit O
card O
so O
come O
with O
cash O
! O

We O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in O
, O
but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short O
wait B-AS
. O

HIGHLY O
RECOMMENDED O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

A O
must O
try O
! O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-AS
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O
. O

The O
svc B-AS
can O
be O
a O
bit O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
esp O
if O
you O
have O
big O
group O
, O
but O
overall O
the O
restaurant B-AS
is O
a O
must O
! O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
nothing O
special O
, O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
a O
Sushi O
establishment O
in O
Tokyo O
. O

This O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
a O
mind- O
bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
. O

I O
was O
speechless O
by O
the O
horrible O
food B-AS
. O

Bagels B-AS
are O
ok O
, O
but O
be O
sure O
not O
to O
make O
any O
special O
requests O
! O

Wonderful O
strawberry B-AS
daiquiries I-AS
as O
well O
! O

I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
write O
because O
I O
would O
not O
want O
my O
jem O
of O
a O
pizza B-AS
place I-AS
to O
become O
overcrowded O
. O

$ O
20 O
for O
all B-AS
you I-AS
can I-AS
eat I-AS
sushi I-AS
can O
not O
be O
beaten O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
bigger O
sitting O
area O
when O
you O
make O
a O
reservation O
( O
if O
possible O
) O

Very O
, O
very O
nice O

THe O
Pizza B-AS
and O
wine B-AS
were O
excellent O
- O
the O
service B-AS
too O
- O
- O
but O
what O
really O
MADE O
this O
place O
was O
the O
backyard B-AS
dining I-AS
area I-AS
. O

With O
the O
great O
variety O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
I O
eat O
here O
often O
and O
never O
get O
bored O
. O

The O
baked B-AS
clams I-AS
octopus I-AS
we O
shared O
as O
appetizers O
were O
the O
best O
we O
've O
ever O
had O
! O
! O

For O
instance O
, O
plates O
were O
just O
dumped O
on O
the O
table O
, O
I O
was O
handed O
the O
wine O
list O
upside O
down O
, O
etc O
... O
. O

Beef B-AS
noodle I-AS
soup I-AS
is O
good O
as O
well O
. O

Mine O
tasted O
like O
the O
bartender O
had O
forgotten O
to O
add O
the O
tequila O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
good O
, O
especially O
their O
more O
basic B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
and O
the O
drinks B-AS
are O
delicious O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
was O
pretty O
good O
and O
huge O
. O

This O
establishment B-AS
is O
the O
real O
deal O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
look O
appetizing O
as O
it O
's O
covered O
in O
squid O
ink O
and O
it O
turns O
your O
lips O
and O
teeth O
black O
, O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
phenomenal O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
great O
. O

Had O
no O
flavor O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
rude O
and O
not O
attentive O
. O

The O
blond B-AS
wood I-AS
decor I-AS
is O
very O
soothing O
, O
the O
premium B-AS
sake I-AS
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
great O
. O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place B-AS
you O
'd O
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O
and O
still O
keep O
a O
secret O
. O

Go O
there O
once O
and O
oh O
yes O
... O
you O
will O
go O
back O
... O
you O
will O
... O

When O
my O
dessert O
came O
, O
there O
was O
a O
candle O
in O
it O
- O
not O
because O
anyone O
asked O
for O
one O
- O
but O
because O
the O
waiter B-AS
must O
have O
seen O
me O
opening O
my O
birthday O
card O
and O
gift O
, O
and O
said O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occassion O
of O
some O
sort O
. O

Their O
bagels B-AS
are O
fine O
, O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked O
, O
and O
not O
really O
a O
'special O
' O
bagel O
experience O
. O

Despite O
the O
confusing O
mirrors B-AS
this O
will O
likely O
be O
my O
go O
- O
to O
for O
modern B-AS
Japanese I-AS
food I-AS
for O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
. O

We O
were O
drawn O
into O
the O
belly B-AS
dancing I-AS
show I-AS
that O
captivated O
the O
crowd O
. O

There O
is O
`` O
Expensive- O
but- O
worth- O
it O
'' O
and O
there O
is O
`` O
Expensive- O
and- O
WTF O
'' O
? O

We O
had O
the O
scallops B-AS
as O
an O
appetizer O
and O
they O
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
sauce B-AS
was O
wonderful O
. O

Great O
vibe B-AS
, O
lots O
of O
people O
. O

Ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

A O
little O
crowded O
but O
they O
move O
that O
line O
really O
fast O
! O

The O
waitress B-AS
was O
very O
patient O
with O
us O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
phenomenal O
! O

Service B-AS
was O
slow O
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food O
although O
not O
crowded O
. O

We O
were O
planning O
to O
get O
dessert O
but O
the O
waitress B-AS
basically O
through O
the O
bill O
at O
us O
before O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
order O
. O

To O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
, O
three O
of O
us O
went O
to O
Mare O
anticipating O
great O
food O
. O

The O
porcini B-AS
mushroom I-AS
pasta I-AS
special I-AS
was O
tasteless O
, O
so O
was O
the O
seafood B-AS
tagliatelle I-AS
. O

Don O
’ O
t O
go O
to O
this O
place B-AS
! O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
the O
Jekyll B-AS
and I-AS
hyde I-AS
Pub I-AS
last O
night O
. O

Kind O
of O
a O
small O
place B-AS
but O
I O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O
. O

Overall O
, O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

Highly O
impressed O
from O
the O
decor B-AS
to O
the O
food B-AS
to O
the O
hospitality O
to O
the O
great O
night O
I O
had O
! O

Patroon O
features O
a O
nice O
cigar B-AS
bar I-AS
and O
has O
great O
staff B-AS
. O

i O
actually O
feel O
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret O
. O

The O
in B-AS
- I-AS
house I-AS
lady I-AS
DJ I-AS
on O
Saturday O
nights O
has O
outrageously O
good O
taste O
in O
music O
, O
and O
moreover O
, O
takes O
requests O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
excellent O
. O

The O
Dancing B-AS
, I-AS
White I-AS
River I-AS
and I-AS
Millenium I-AS
rolls I-AS
are O
musts O
. O

enough O
said O
! O

Loved O
it O
! O

The O
food B-AS
here O
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
. O

As O
a O
Japanese O
native O
, O
I O
've O
lived O
in O
the O
Tristate O
area O
for O
over O
8 O
years O
, O
but O
I O
was O
just O
so O
amazed O
at O
this O
place B-AS
. O

Try O
their O
chef B-AS
's I-AS
specials I-AS
- O
- O
they O
are O
to O
die O
for O
. O

Try O
the O
Pad B-AS
Thai I-AS
, O
it O
's O
fabulous O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
so O
cheap O
! O

We O
did O
n't O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O
in O
there O
so O
unfortunately O
I O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

Great O
pizza B-AS
and O
fantastic O
service B-AS
. O

We O
ordered O
some O
beef B-AS
and I-AS
noodle I-AS
soup I-AS
dishes I-AS
from O
the O
Thai O
section O
of O
the O
menu O
but O
nothing O
we O
got O
was O
Thai O
. O

We O
've O
found O
it O
to O
be O
better O
and O
fresher O
than O
Kiku O
which O
is O
comparable O
in O
price O
. O

Once O
you O
try O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
beware.. O
you O
ca O
n't O
stop O
! O

Pizza O
- O
the O
only O
pizza B-AS
in O
NYC O
that O
should O
not O
have O
additional O
toppings O
- O
the O
crust B-AS
tastes O
like O
the O
best O
, O
freshly O
baked O
bread O
! O

I O
recommend O
this O
place B-AS
to O
everyone O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
have O
the O
Spicy B-AS
Scallop I-AS
roll I-AS
.. O
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
finished O
our O
dinner O
we O
still O
had O
not O
received O
one O
beverage O
NOR O
hooka O
! O

My O
mom O
originally O
introduced O
me O
to O
this O
place O
, O
but O
even O
she O
( O
being O
Indian O
) O
feels O
the O
food B-AS
can O
be O
somewhat O
over O
the O
top O
spicy O
and O
far O
too O
oily O
. O

The O
food B-AS
we O
ordered O
was O
excellent O
, O
although O
I O
would O
n't O
say O
the O
margaritas B-AS
were O
anything O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare B-AS
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood O
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
. O

And O
I O
've O
been O
to O
many O
NYC O
delis O
. O

Here O
the O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
is O
elevated O
to O
the O
level O
of O
a O
real O
entree O
with O
numerous O
variations O
available O
. O

overpriced O
japanese B-AS
food I-AS
with O
mediocre O
service B-AS

they O
were O
dry O
and O
disgusting O
, O
i O
did O
n't O
even O
finish O
my O
first O
piece O
. O

Since O
we O
were O
already O
waiting O
so O
long O
, O
we O
felt O
we O
had O
no O
other O
choice O
but O
to O
accept O
it O
. O

La B-AS
Rosa I-AS
waltzes O
in O
, O
and O
I O
think O
they O
are O
doing O
it O
the O
best O
. O

He O
served O
me O
an O
Uni B-AS
Hand I-AS
roll I-AS
, O
which O
I O
never O
had O
before O
, O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
... O
IT O
WAS O
HEAVEN O
! O

The O
chicken B-AS
pot I-AS
pie I-AS
is O
excpetiona O
, O
the O
cheeseburger B-AS
huge O
and O
delictable O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
professional O
wan O
warm O
. O

Inexpensive O
, O
unassuming O
, O
great O
time O
! O

Thank O

everyone O
at O
Water B-AS
's I-AS
Edge I-AS
. O

MMMMMMMMMmmmmmm O
so O
delicious O

I O
definitely O
would O
n't O
go O
back O
. O

The O
food B-AS
they O
serve O
is O
not O
comforting O
, O
not O
appetizing O
and O
uncooked O
. O

The O
Steak B-AS
Tartare I-AS
is O
a O
great O
bet O
, O
they O
fix O
it O
for O
you O
at O
the O
table O
. O

Zero O
ambiance B-AS
to O
boot O
. O

I O
honestly O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
where O
to O
begin O
. O

Consistently O
good O
Japanese B-AS
Tapas I-AS

I O
lOVE O
THIS O
PLACE B-AS

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
place B-AS
! O
! O

The O
food B-AS
is O
authentic O
Italian O
- O
delicious O
! O

Its O
located O
in O
greenewich O
village O
. O

believe O
us O
, O
we O
've O
been O
eating O
sushi O
for O
over O
15 O
yrs O
. O

I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
EVER O
HAD O
SUCH O
AN O
UNPLEASANT O
EXPERIENCE O
. O

The O
cold B-AS
appetizer I-AS
dishes I-AS
taste O
like O
the O
way O
I O
remember O
them O
to O
taste O
when O
I O
was O
growing O
up O
in O
Taiwan O
. O

Wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
blantently O
unappreciative O
of O
your O
business O
but O
its O
the O
best O
pie B-AS
on O
the O
UWS O
! O

The O
food B-AS
here O
is O
rather O
good O
, O
but O
only O
if O
you O
like O
to O
wait O
for O
it O
. O

How O
is O
this O
palce B-AS
still O
open O
? O

i O
know O
, O
you O
were O
too O
busy O
showing O
off O
your O
vintage O
tee O
shirt O
and O
looking O
bored O
, O
but O
my O
agenda O
is O
i O
'm O
here O
to O
eat O
and O
enjoy O
the O
company O
of O
friends O
, O
seeking O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
. O

I O
pray O
it O
stays O
open O
forever O
. O

Maybe O
it O
was O
the O
great O
company O
( O
I O
had O
friends O
visiting O
from O
Philly O
– O
yes O
, O
it O
was O
not O
a O
date O
this O
time O
) O
or O
the O
super O
reasonable O
price O
point O
, O
but O
I O
just O
can O
’ O
t O
say O
enough O
good O
things O
about O
this O
brasserie B-AS
. O

Very O
cozy O
and O
warm O
inside O
... O
.. O

It O
's O
to O
die O
for O
! O

Stay O
away O

Worth O
visiting O
the O
1st B-AS
Ave I-AS
spot I-AS
because O
it O
is O
the O
original O
store O
. O

Delicious O
, O
creative O
and O
fun O
. O

It O
melted O
in O
my O
little O
mouth O
and O
the O
perfect O
consistency- O
not O
too O
fishy O
, O
creamy O
, O
and O
slightly O
buttery O
. O

Pizza B-AS
was O
a O
little O
soggy O
. O

I O
have O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
and O
have O
nothing O
but O
good O
things O
to O
say O
about O
the O
service B-AS
and O
the O
great O
staff B-AS
at O
La O
Lanterna O
. O

Why O
? O

In O
fact O
there O
is O
only O
one O
I O
've O
tried O
that O
even O
compares O
( O
shabu O
Tatsu O
) O
and O
even O
then O
I O
prefer O
Dokebi O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
a O
lot O
of O
pizza O
here O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
the O
other O
night O
and O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
magnificent O
. O

Personal B-AS
pans I-AS
are O
the O
perfect O
size O
for O
those O
hungry O
nights O
. O

My O
friend O
from O
Milan O
and O
myself O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
everyone O
spoke O
italian O
. O

The O
lobster B-AS
sandwich I-AS
is O
$ O
24 O
and O
although O
it O
was O
good O
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price O
. O

We O
were O
less O
than O
impressed O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

Went O
to O
Ottimo O
and O
was O
expecting O
outstanding O
pizza O
( O
as O
I O
love O
La O
Pizza O
Fresca O
) O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
was O
rude O
and O
I O
got O
a O
distinct O
feeling O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
serve O
us O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
both O
ordered O
the O
Steak O
, O
medium O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommand O
requesting O
a O
table O
by O
the O
window O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
yummy O
, O
especially O
their O
cooked O
- O
to O
- O
perfection O
mussels B-AS
in I-AS
spicy I-AS
tomato I-AS
sauce I-AS
and O
their O
shoestring O
crispy O
fries B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
they O
have O
a O
good O
selecion B-AS
of I-AS
wines I-AS
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

She O
replied O
`` O
well O
it O
would O
be O
more O
convenient O
for O
us O
if O
you O
ordered O
now O
, O
since O
you O
are O
a O
larger O
party O
, O
and O
it O
might O
get O
crowded O
. O
'' O

The O
level O
of O
rudeness O
was O
preposterous O
. O

If O
you O
venture O
off O
the O
island O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
ca O
n't O
seem O
to O
find O
a O
great O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
drive O
to O
Corona B-AS
. O

Love O
this O
place B-AS
, O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
city O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
places O
we O
always O
go O
. O

my O
favorite O
place B-AS
lol O

Service B-AS
is O
average O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
proprietor B-AS
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
in O
NYC O
. O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
date O
spot O
for O
Williamsburg O
couples O
. O

The O
service B-AS
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
from O
feeling O
like O
you O
are O
rushed O
the O
place O
your O
order O
, O
to O
being O
ignored O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
was O
nice O
, O
but O
service B-AS
was O
n't O
so O
great O
. O

Good O
Food B-AS

The O
food B-AS
looked O
very O
appetizing O
and O
delicious O
since O
it O
came O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
fancy O
plates O
. O

During O
the O
course O
of O
the O
past O
3 O
months O
, O
the O
chef B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
changed O
and O
it O
was O
not O
for O
the O
better O
. O

Dokebi O
gives O
Williamsburg O
the O
right O
one O
- O
two O
punch O
of O
classic O
Korean B-AS
food I-AS
and O
fusion B-AS
twists I-AS
like O
pork B-AS
belly I-AS
tacos I-AS
. O

I O
had O
never O
had O
Edamame B-AS
pureed I-AS
before O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
( O
could O
've O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt O
) O
. O

Went O
on O
a O
3 O
day O
oyster O
binge O
, O
with O
Fish B-AS
bringing O
up O
the O
closing O
, O
and O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
this O
was O
the O
place O
it O
O O
trip O
ended O
, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great O
! O

Although O
they O
do O
the O
typical O
what O
kind O
of O
water O
would O
you O
like O
questions O
the O
service B-AS
was O
good O
and O
overall O
very O
relaxing O
to O
place B-AS
to O
eat O
. O

With O
the O
theater O
2 O
blocks O
away O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal B-AS

THe O

sitting I-AS
area I-AS
is O
very O
pleasant O
, O
where O
you O
can O
see O
their O
personal O

garden O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
( O
I O
had O
a O
halibut B-AS
special I-AS
, O
my O
husband O
had O
steak B-AS
) O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
top O
- O
notch O
. O

DO O
not O
try O
unless O
you O
're O
just O
going O
there O
to O
hang O
out O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
hipsters O
who O
apparently O
have O
no O
sense O
of O
taste O
. O

Staff B-AS
is O
very O
accomodating O
. O

They O
're O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
and O
not O
very O
friendly O

instead O
of O
the O
cheap O
, O
frozen O
, O
shredded O
cheese O
common O
to O
most O
pizzaria O
's O
. O

If O
you O
go O
here O
, O
do O
it O
on O
his O
off- O
night O
. O

It O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
with O
live O
entertainment O
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
Disney O
type O
special O
effects O
. O

Okay- O
i O
do O
n't O
mind O
the O
oily O
part O
( O
cause O
most O
are O
cooked O
that O
way O
) O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
bland O
. O

A O
different O
server B-AS
enhanced O
the O
fun O
, O
dumping O
our O
entrees O
in O
front O
of O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
appetizer B-AS
( O
which O
was O
delicious O
) O
. O

This O
is O
such O
a O
lovely O
, O
peaceful O
place B-AS
to O
eat O
outside O
. O

We O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food O
anymore O
. O

The O
flavors O
are O
amazing O
and O
the O
value O
is O
phenomenal O
. O

When O
you O
're O
sitting O
in O
their O
main B-AS
dining I-AS
room I-AS
( O
which O
has O
a O
spectacular O
, O
hand O
- O
painted O
high O
ceiling B-AS
) O
you O
'd O
never O
know O
there O
was O
a O
world O
outside O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
delivered O
our O
food O
while O
holding O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
plastic O
bag O
of O
garbage O
in O
one O
hand O
. O

If O
you O
like O
the O
food O
and O
the O
value O
you O
get O
from O
some O
of O
Chinatown O
restaurants O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
you O
. O

At O
first O
glance O
this O
place O
seems O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
a O
hot O
dog O
joint O
, O
but O
at O
Bark B-AS
you O
do O
n't O
just O
get O
your O
average O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
. O

Not O
worth O
it O
. O

Big B-AS
Wong I-AS
gets O
big O
Ups O
for O
a O
fine O
establishment O
. O

less O
wait O
time O
for O
me O
! O

Service B-AS
was O
slow O
, O
but O
the O
people B-AS
were O
friendly O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
OK O
. O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
there O
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
down O
to O
earth O
. O

My O
fav O
was O
the O
sassy B-AS
lassi I-AS
... O

Our O
teenage O
kids O
love O
it O
, O
too O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
fantastic O
. O

Great O
find O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
! O

Do O
n't O
judge O
this O
place B-AS
prima O
facie O
, O
you O
have O
to O
try O
it O
to O
believe O
it O
, O
a O
home O
away O
from O
home O
for O
the O
literate O
heart O
. O

Avoid O
this O
place B-AS
! O

I O
work O
around O
the O
corner O
and O
tried O
it O
with O
a O
colleague O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

Look O
, O
the O
appetizers B-AS
were O
really O
good O
. O

The O
seafood B-AS
is O
amazing O
, O
there O
's O
a O
good O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
, O
and O
the O
ever O
- O
changing O
menu B-AS
always O
offers O
some O
great O
surprises O
. O

It O
's O
just O
average O
, O
just O
shredded O
, O
no O
seasoning O
on O
it O
. O

the O
salads B-AS
are O
delicious O
, O
both O
refreshing O
and O
very O
spicy O
. O

The O
sushi B-AS
seemed O
pretty O
fresh O
and O
was O
adequately O
proportioned O
. O

The O
sangria B-AS
was O
pretty O
tasty O
and O
good O
on O
a O
hot O
muggy O
day O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
time O
writing O
a O
review O
for O
a O
restaurant O
because O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
was O
excellent O
. O

great O
food B-AS

But O
that O
was O
n't O
the O
icing O
on O
the O
cake O
: O
a O
tiramisu B-AS
that O
resembled O
nothing O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

MMmmm O
... O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

They O
wouldnt O
even O
let O
me O
finish O
my O
glass O
of O
wine O
before O
offering O
another O
. O

We O
had O
the O
lobster B-AS
sandwich I-AS
and O
it O
was O
FANTASTIC O
. O

I O
go O
and O
eat O
out O
at O
many O
different O
restaurants O
and O
this O
is O
one O
place B-AS
you O
have O
go O
and O
try O
. O

As O
always O
we O
had O
a O
great O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
while O
we O
waited O
. O

Ciao O
Bella O

Watch O
the O
talented O
belly B-AS
dancers I-AS
as O
you O
enjoy O
delicious O
baba B-AS
ganoush I-AS
that O
's O
more O
lemony O
than O
smoky O
. O

I O
did O
not O
try O
the O
caviar O
but O
I O
tried O
their O
salmon B-AS
and O
crab B-AS
salad I-AS
( O
they O
are O
all O
good O
) O

Great O
, O
original O
taste O
. O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
back O
here O
. O

The O
sake B-AS
’ I-AS
s I-AS
complimented O
the O
courses O
very O
well O
and O
is O
successfully O
easing O
me O
into O
the O
sake O
world O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
thrilled O
to O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
for O
thirty O
minutes O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
that O
's O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O
place O
. O

Go O
here O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
but O
not O
for O
an O
all O
out O
wow O
dining O
experience O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
vitello B-AS
alla I-AS
marsala I-AS
and O
I O
was O
pretty O
impressed O
. O

awesome O

We O
had O
Pam B-AS
's I-AS
special I-AS
fried I-AS
fish I-AS
and O
it O
was O
amazing O
. O

I O
love O
it O
. O

The O
anti B-AS
- I-AS
pasta I-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
especially O
the O
calamari B-AS
, O
as O
were O
the O
filling O
pasta B-AS
mains I-AS
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
other O
great O
places O
to O
go O
to O
eat O
and O
drink O
... O
.. O
this O
place O
is O
not O
worth O
it O
... O

not O
sure O
why O
this O
restaurant B-AS
would O
be O
rated O
that O
highly O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
New B-AS
England I-AS
Chowder I-AS
it O
was O
good O
but O
I O
think O
the O
award O
should O
go O
to O
the O
Lobster B-AS
Bisque I-AS
. O

The O
have O
over O
100 O
different O
beers B-AS
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
, O
if O
I O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish O
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B-AS
tortelini I-AS
. O

Great O
wine B-AS
selection I-AS
, O
Gigondas B-AS
is O
worth O
the O
price O
, O
and O
the O
house B-AS
champagne I-AS
is O
a O
great O
value O
. O

In O
summer O
- O
eat O
outside O
on O
a O
terrace B-AS
( O
another O
great O
feature O
of O
Suan O
) O
! O
! O
! O

When O
we O
sat O
, O
we O
got O
great O
and O
fast O
service B-AS
. O

Will O
comeback O
for O
sure O
, O
wish O
they O
have O
it O
here O
in O
LA.. O

Try O
everything O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
it O
is O
all O
good O
. O

Love O
the O
scene B-AS
first O
off O
- O
the O
place B-AS
has O
a O
character O
and O
nice O
light O
to O
it..very O
fortunate O
, O
location B-AS
wise O
. O

Quite O
simply O
it O
's O
like O
stepping O
out O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
into O
a O
haven O
of O
tranquility O
. O

The O
filet B-AS
mignon I-AS
dish I-AS
was O
superb O
! O

The O
reason O
there O
are O
4 O
different O
results O
on O
citysearch O
for O
the O
same O
place O
is O
because O
they O
keep O
trying O
to O
start O
a O
new O
thread O
so O
they O
can O
stock O
it O
with O
positive O
reviews O
. O

Good O
Experience O

It O
looked O
like O
shredded O
cheese O
partly O
done O
- O
still O
in O
strips O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
try O
this O
place B-AS
as O
often O
as O
you O
can O
. O

It O
is O
quite O
a O
spectacular O
scene B-AS
i O
'll O
give O
them O
that O
. O

We O
were O
n't O
even O
at O
our O
table O
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
total O
. O

So O
, O
if O
you O
're O
walking O
by O
and O
thinking O
about O
dining O
, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
see O
who O
's O
going O
to O
be O
seating O
you O
first O
... O

A O
beautifully O
designed O
dreamy O
Egyptian B-AS
restaurant I-AS
that O
gets O
sceney O
at O
night O
. O

Fresh O
, O
mind O
blowing O
flavors O
. O

Would O
n't O
recomend O
it O
for O
dinner O
! O

My O
friend O
got O
the O
mushroom B-AS
pizza I-AS
which O
tasted O
better O
. O

Hurley O
's O
is O
like O
Cheers O
where O
everyone O
knows O
your O
name O
and O
they O
are O
ACTUALLY O
glad O
you O
came O
. O

After O
the O
4th O
time O
i O
asked O
again O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
than O
said O
after O
our O
dinner O
. O

those O
rolls B-AS
were O
big O
, O
but O
not O
good O
and O
sashimi B-AS
was O
n't O
fresh O
. O

I O
take O
all O
my O
NYC O
guests O
to O
VT B-AS
's I-AS
. O

The O
whole O
set O
up O
is O
truly O
unprofessional O
and O
I O
wish O
Cafe B-AS
Noir I-AS
would O
get O
some O
good O
staff B-AS
, O
because O
despite O
the O
current O
one O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place O
. O

We O
were O
fast O
to O
order O
the O
appetizer O
platter O
since O
we O
were O
very O
hungry O
. O

As O
a O
student O
in O
NYU O
i O
need O
a O
place O
to O
eat O
after O
a O
hard O
day O
of O
work O
so O
usually O
i O
just O
go O
to O
any O
indian O
restraunt O
near O
by O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
, O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
could O
n't O
get O
a O
table O
. O

I O
love O
Ess- O
a- O
bagel O
, O
but O
I O
live O
on O
the O
west O
side O
, O
so O
I O
often O
go O
to O
Murray O
's O
for O
convenience O
. O

I O
would O
defiantly O
come O
back O
here O
again O
as O
one O
of O
my O
top O
choices O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
attentive O
. O

We O
ate O
out O
in O
the O
back B-AS
patio I-AS
, O
which O
is O
worth O
it O
as O
it O
's O
cool O
and O
the O
music B-AS
is O
hear O
well O
there O
. O

Everything O
was O
going O
good O
until O
we O
got O
our O
meals B-AS
. O

To O
sum O
it O
up O
: O
Service B-AS
varies O
from O
good O
to O
mediorce O
, O
depending O
on O
which O
waiter O
you O
get O
; O
generally O
it O
is O
just O
average O
Ok O
. O

I O
got O
the O
$ B-AS
10 I-AS
10 I-AS
- I-AS
piece I-AS
dim I-AS
sum I-AS
combo I-AS
, O
every O
bite O
of O
which O
was O
great O
. O

I O
read O
reviews O
that O
called O
the O
restaurant B-AS
too O
expensive O
and O
I O
thought O
to O
myself O
, O
but O
may O
be O
it O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

There O
is O
no O
way O
it O
justifies O
the O
accolades O
it O
receives O
, O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
staff B-AS
or O
the O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table O
. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
vegetarian O
but O
, O
almost O
all O
the O
dishes B-AS
were O
great O
. O

I O
'm O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy O
food B-AS
. O

Whether O
it O
's O
the O
parmesean B-AS
porcini I-AS
souffle I-AS
or O
the O
lamb B-AS
glazed I-AS
with I-AS
balsamic I-AS
vinegar I-AS
, O
you O
will O
surely O
be O
transported O
to O
Northern O
Italy O
with O
one O
bite O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place B-AS
to O
take O
out O
- O
of O
- O
towners O
, O
and O
perfect O
for O
watching O
the O
sunset O
. O

P.S O
. O
Please O
do O
n't O
tell O
anyone O
in O
my O
family O
i O
eat O
there O
. O

It O
is O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

We O
had O
a O
good O
time O
. O

The O
service O
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
unimposing O
, O
the O
food O
was O
far O
better O
than O
many O
notorious O
restaurants O
in O
Midtown O
and O
the O
wine O
list O
is O
extensive O
and O
well O
priced O
. O

this O
place O
... O
we O
stumbled O
upon O
it O
on O
labor O
day O
weekend O
. O

Open O
late O
( O
well O
as O
late O
as O
I O
ever O
got O
there O
and O
I O
'm O
a O
night O
person O
) O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
yummy O
and O
I O
like O
the O
atmoshpere B-AS
. O

Worth O
the O
trip O
from O
Manhattan O
. O

We O
were O
very O
disappointed O
. O

They O
all O
know O
you O
. O

Everything O
was O
wonderful O
; O
food B-AS
, O
drinks B-AS
, O
staff B-AS
, O
mileau B-AS
. O

We O
were O
ushered O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
wait O
momentarily O
and O
upon O
arrival O
were O
so O
excited O
. O

Leon B-AS
is O
an O
East O
Village O
gem O
: O
casual O
but O
hip O
, O
with O
well O
prepared O
basic O
French B-AS
bistro I-AS
fare I-AS
, O
good O
specials B-AS
, O
a O
warm O
and O
lively O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

We O
will O
go O
back O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
City O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
very O
freindly O
, O
they O
make O
it O
feel O
like O
you O
're O
eating O
in O
a O
freindly O
little O
european O
town O
. O

The O
lamb B-AS
was O
tender O
so O
full O
of O
flavor O
, O
the O
dessert B-AS
was O
divine O
! O
! O

They O
even O
scoop O
it O
out O
nice O
( O
for O
those O
on O
a O
diet O
) O
not O
too O
much O
not O
to O
little O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
disapointing O
meal B-AS
here O
. O

i O
would O
just O
ask O
for O
no O
oil O
next O
time O
. O

This O
small O
Astoria O
souvlaki O
spot O
makes O
what O
many O
consider O
the O
best O
gyros B-AS
in O
New O
York O
. O

Finally O
a O
reliable O
Chinese B-AS
restaurant I-AS
! O

The O
entree B-AS
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

The O
dessert O
( O
we O
had O
a O
pear B-AS
torte I-AS
) O
was O
good O
- O
but O
, O
once O
again O
, O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
unable O
to O
provide O
appropriate O
drink O
suggestions O
. O

No O
, O
really O
. O

When O
we O
inquired O
about O
ports O
- O
the O
waitress B-AS
listed O
off O
several O
but O
did O
not O
know O
taste O
variations O
or O
cost O
. O

Excellent O
sashimi B-AS
, O
and O
the O
millennium B-AS
roll I-AS
is O
beyond O
delicious O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
to O
make O
reservations O
, O
but O
both O
times O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
did O
n't O
have O
my O
name O
. O

The O
dosas B-AS
are O
skimpy O
, O
unattractive O
and O
drip O
with O
grease O
, O
and O
personally O
I O
'd O
drink O
popcorn O
topping O
before O
I O
'd O
eat O
another O
one O
of O
these O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
would O
return O
- O
as O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant B-AS
- O
but O
I O
hope O
the O
staff B-AS
pays O
more O
attention O
to O
the O
little O
details O
in O
the O
future O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
a O
must O
visit O
! O

Once O
you O
step O
into O
Cosette B-AS
, O
you O
're O
miraculously O
in O
a O
small O
, O
off O
- O
the O
- O
beaten O
path O
Parisian O
bistro O
. O

Amazing O
! O

The O
space B-AS
kind O
of O
feels O
like O
an O
Alice O
in O

Excellent O

My O
GF O
and O
I O
dine O
at O
Bukhara O
often O
as O
she O
lives O
near O
it O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
beautiful O
place B-AS
. O

Immediately O
after O
we O
paid O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
took O
the O
money O
and O
said O
, O
okay O
, O
you O
guys O
are O
outta O
here O
. O

The O
appetizing O
is O
excellent O
- O
just O
as O
good O
as O
Zabars O
Barney O
Greengrass O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
( O
if O
bought O
by O
the O
pound O
) O
. O

My O
father O
had O
the O
flank B-AS
steak I-AS
which O
was O
very O
good O
, O
and O
my O
mother O
had O
the O
swordfish O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
the O
friendliest O
that O
have O
seen O
in O
New O
York O
. O

the O
food B-AS
is O
always O
fresh O
... O

Out O
of O
the O
hundreds O
of O
Italian O
restaurants O
in O
Queens O
, O
this O
is O
among O
the O
best O
. O

The O
crust B-AS
is O
thin O
, O
the O
ingredients B-AS
are O
fresh O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
friendly O
. O

They O
have O
a O
delicious O
banana B-AS
chocolate I-AS
dessert I-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
great O
green B-AS
tea I-AS
tempura I-AS
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
second O
floor O
walk- O
up O
two O
Fridays O
ago O
when O
I O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O
town O
from O
L.A O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
quick O
and O
friendly O
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
comfort O
food O
places O
in O
the O
city O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
midtown O
gem O
instantly O
became O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
sushi O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Sometimes O
tables O
do O
n't O
understand O
his O
sense O
of O
humor O
but O
it O
's O
refreshing O
to O
have O
a O
server B-AS
who O
has O
personality O
, O
professionalism O
, O
and O
respects O
the O
privacy O
of O
your O
dinner O
. O

I O
will O
be O
back O
! O

The O
food B-AS
is O
delicious O
- O
from O
the O
specials B-AS
to O
the O
regular B-AS
menu I-AS
- I-AS
fare I-AS
, O
the O
dishes B-AS
are O
never O
a O
disappointment O
. O

Enjoyed O
a O
very O
nice O
Caesar B-AS
Salad I-AS
while O
my O
wife O
had O
arugula B-AS
and I-AS
goat I-AS
cheese I-AS
... O
.both O
very O
tasty O
. O

Dessert B-AS
: O
pure O
disaster O
. O

Still O
we O
keep O
going O
back O
: O
) O

Go O
to O
son O
cubano O
in O
edgewater O
nj O
instead O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
great O
. O

What O
? O

but O
overall O
i O
give O
it O
a O
10 O

The O
hostess B-AS
was O
very O
pleasant O
. O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
better O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
in O
all O
of O
the O
city O
. O

I O
thought O
I O
had O
died O
and O
gone O
to O
heaven O
. O

Wo O
n't O
or O
Ca O
n't O
is O
not O
in O
the O
service O
directory O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
would O
go O
again O
. O

We O
also O
asked O
for O
Hooka O
six O
times O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
kept O
telling O
us O
one O
minute O
and O
never O
returning O
with O
the O
Hooka O
. O

The O
best O
! O

Patsy B-AS
's I-AS
Pizza I-AS
= O
true O
love O

The O
bar B-AS
is O
very O
well O
stocked O
with O
interesting O
beers B-AS
and O
well O
priced O
wines B-AS
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
is O
rude O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
offensive O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

Just O
ignore O
the O
trendy O
wannabes O
. O

In O
an O
area O
sadly O
lacking O
in O
decent O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
spots O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
also O
horrible O
and O
the O
ambience B-AS
is O
not O
that O
great O
. O

Been O
there O
, O
done O
that O
, O
and O
New O
York O
, O
it O
's O
not O
that O
big O
a O
deal O
. O

I O
have O
known O
about O
this O
secret O
for O
the O
last O
13 O
years O
, O
Emilio O
( O
the O
Godfather O
) O
has O
continued O
to O
serve O
food B-AS
and O
wine B-AS
for O
the O
gods O
at O
mortal O
prices O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
there O
's O
hookah B-AS
. O

This O
place O
has O
totally O
weird O
decor B-AS
, O
stairs O
going O
up O
with O
mirrored B-AS
walls I-AS
- O
I O
am O
surprised O
how O
no O
one O
yet O
broke O
their O
head O
or O
fall O
off O
the O
stairs O
- O
mirrored O
walls O
make O
you O
dizzy O
and O
delusional O
... O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

However O
, O
once O
I O
received O
my O
predictably O
mediocre O
order O
of O
what O
Dokebi O
thinks O
passes O
as O
Korean B-AS
fair I-AS
, O
( O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
settle O
when O
it O
's O
your O
only O
option O
) O
, O
I O
got O
through O
about O
half O
my O
kimchee B-AS
before O
I O
found O
a O
piece O
of O
random O
lettuce O
accompanied O
by O
a O
far O
more O
disgusting O
, O
slimy O
, O
clearly O
bad O
piece O
of O
fish O
skin O
. O

Great O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
incredible O
. O

For O
starters O
they O
delivered O
us O
someone O
else O
's O
order O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
is O
good O
, O
but O
I O
've O
had O
better O
for O
cheaper O
. O

Priced O
at O
upper O
intermediate O
range O
. O

the O
turkey B-AS
burgers I-AS
are O
scary O
! O

also O
it O
's O
great O
to O
have O
dinner O
in O
a O
very O
romantic O
and O
confortable O
place B-AS
, O
the O
service B-AS
it O
's O
just O
perfect O
... O
they O
're O
so O
frendly O
that O
we O
never O
want O
to O
live O
the O
place O
! O

All O
of O
the O
pizzas B-AS
are O
terrific O
and O
the O
price O
is O
even O
better O
! O

Overpriced O
and O
not O
tasty O

I O
had O
the O
Thai B-AS
style I-AS
Fried I-AS
Sea I-AS
Bass I-AS
... O
which O
was O
very O
good O
. O

They O
should O
have O
called O
it O
mascarpone O
with O
chocolate O
chips- O
good O
but O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
what O
the O
name O
implies O
. O

I O
was O
shocked O
that O
my O
friends O
wanted O
to O
stay O
after O
the O
waitress B-AS
said O
, O
`` O
can O
I O
help O
you O
'' O
and O
`` O
how O
many O
are O
in O
your O
party O
. O
'' O

There O
was O
a O
small O
wait B-AS
, O
but O
shorter O
than O
I O
expected O
. O

People B-AS
are O
always O
friendly O
. O

I O
LOVE O
their O
Thai B-AS

While O
finishing O
our O
meals O
which O
included O
a O
high O
- O
end O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
our O
son O
's O
fiance O
joined O
us O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
dessert O
. O

The O
lobster B-AS
knuckles I-AS
( O
special O
of O
the O
day O
) O
were O
ok O
, O
but O
pretty O
tasteless O
. O

Hands O
down O
the O
best O
pizza B-AS
on O
the O
planet O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
devine O
, O
oysters B-AS
where O
a O
sensual O
as O
they O
come O
, O
and O
the O
price O
ca O
n't O
be O
beat O
! O
! O
! O

Ambience B-AS
is O
so O
cute O
and O
quaint O
, O
good O
for O
business O
although O
we O
were O
there O
on O
vacation O
. O

We O
went O
to O
celebrate O
two O
birthdays O
and O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
special O
and O
different O
. O

Veal O
Parmigana O
- O
Better O
than O
Patsy O
's O
! O

Cheese B-AS
plate I-AS
is O
a O
varied O
delight O
and O
great O
bargain O
at O
$ O
10 O
. O

After O
hearing O
a O
lot O
of O
great O
things O
about O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
passing O
by O
it O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
try O
. O

Price O
and O
quality O
of O
fish B-AS
alone O
will O
keep O
us O
from O
making O
a O
return O
visit O
. O

This O
place B-AS
survives O
on O
reputation O
alone O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
as O
if O
this O
restaurant B-AS
had O
any O
major O
bragging O
points O
before O
hand O
, O
but O
now O
it O
's O
simply O
repulsive O
. O

We O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu B-AS
chocolate B-AS
cake I-AS
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

I O
visit O
New O
Green O
Bo O
when O
I O
have O
money O
or O
when O
I O
am O
broke O
. O

We O
even O
had O
a O
visit O
from O
the O
Manager B-AS
who O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
we O
were O
enjoying O
ourselves O
. O

Service B-AS
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

Just O
went O
here O
for O
my O
girlfriends O
23rd O
bday O
. O

I O
was O
there O
for O
brunch O
recently O
, O
and O
we O
were O
tag O
teamed O
by O
a O
waitress B-AS
and O
a O
waiter B-AS
. O

Coming O
from O
Boston O
this O
place O
is O
like O
Emma O
's O
Pizza O
in O
Kendall O
Square O
in O
Cambridge O
( O
although O
they O
have O
more O
funky O
toppings O
! O
) O

A O
guaranteeed O
delight O
! O

I O
absolutely O
Loved O
this O
place B-AS
. O

I O
found O
the O
food B-AS
, O
service B-AS
and O
value O
exceptional O
everytime O
I O
have O
been O
there O
. O

This O
was O
my O
frist O
time O
at O
Cafe O
St. O
Bart O
's O
and O
I O
must O
say O
how O
delicous O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
. O

I O
have O
been O
twice O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

Awesome O

It O
was O
served O
with O
skin O
, O
over O
a O
bed O
of O
extremely O
undercooked O
spinach B-AS
and O
mashed O
potatoes O
. O

Great O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS

A O
beef O
Consomme O
. O

I O
have O
never O
left O
a O
restaurant B-AS
feeling O
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused O
, O
and O
wasted O
my O
hard O
earned O
money O
. O

So O
rude O
! O
! O
! O

I O
had O
Filet O
Mignon O
with O
garlic O
mash O
. O

The O
main B-AS
entree I-AS
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
and O
heartily O
recommend O
it O
! O

if O
you O
're O
daring O
, O
try O
the O
balsamic B-AS
vinegar I-AS
over I-AS
icecream I-AS
, O
it O
's O
wonderful O
! O
